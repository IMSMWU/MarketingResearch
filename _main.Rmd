# Getting started

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/Graphics/Rlogo.png" alt="R Logo" width="20%"></p>

In this course, we will work with the statistical software package <b>R</b>. Please make sure R is already installed on your computer before the tutorials start. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) contains compiled versions of the program that are ready to use free of charge: 

* "[Download R](http://cran.r-project.org)" [FREE download]

<b>RStudio</b> provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes working with R easier. You can also download RStudio for free:

* "[Download R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)(Windows, Linux, OSX, …).
* Contains statistical routines not yet available in other programs.
* Active global community (e.g., <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/" target="_blank">https://www.r-bloggers.com/</a>).
* Many specialized user-written packages.
* It has its own journal (e.g., <a href="http://journal.r-project.org" target="_blank">http://journal.r-project.org</a>).
* Highly integrated and interfaces to other programs.
* It is becoming increasingly popular among practitioners.
* It is a valuable skill to have on the job market.
* It is not as complicated as you might think.
* R is powerful.
* …

</div>
## Getting help

* Built-in R tutorial: type in “help.start()” to get to the official R tutorial
* Questions regarding specific functions: type in “?function_name” to get to the help page of specific functions (e.g., “?lm” gives you help on the lm() function)
* Video tutorials: Make use of one of the many video tutorials on YouTube (e.g., [http://www.r-bloggers.com/learn-r-from-the-ground-up](http://www.r-bloggers.com/learn-r-from-the-ground-up/)[/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZrAYxWPN6c)).
* Errors & warnings: because R is interactive, consider errors your friends!
* Most importantly: the more time you spend using R, the more comfortable you become with it and it will be easier to see its  advantages 
* R Cheatsheets: Cheat sheets make it easy to learn about and use some popular packages (<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/" target="_blank">https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/</a>). They can also be accessed from within RStudio under the "help" menu. 

## Functions

When analyzing data in R, you will access most of the functionalities by calling functions. A <b>function</b> is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task (e.g., the ```lm()```-function to run a linear regression). It may or may not accept arguments or parameters and it may or may not return one or more values. Functions are generally called like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
```

To give you an example, let's use the built-in ```seq()```-function to generate a sequence of numbers. RStudio has some nice features that help you when writing code. For example, when you type "se" and hit TAB, a pop-up shows you possible completions. The more letters you type in, the more precise the suggestions will become and you will notice that after typing in the third letter, a pop-up with possible completions will appear automatically and you can select the desired function using the ↑/↓ arrows and hitting ENTER. The pop-up even reminds you of the arguments that a function takes. If you require more details, you may either press the F1 key or type in ```?seq``` and you will find the details for the function in the help tab in the lower right pane. When you have selected the desired function from the pop-up, RStudio will automatically add matching opening and closing parentheses (i.e., go from ```seq``` to ```seq()```). Within the parentheses you may now type in the arguments that the function takes. Let's use ```seq()``` to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10. To do this, you may include the argument names (i.e., ```from = ```, ```to = ```), or just the desired values in the correct order.  
An important thing to note is that R is case-sensitive, meaning that ```Seq()``` and ```seq()``` are viewed as two different functions by R.

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10) #creates sequence from 1 to 10
seq(1,10) #same result
```

Note that if you specify the argument names, you may enter them in any order. However, if do not include the argument names you must adhere to the order that is specified for the respective function. 

```{r}
seq(to = 10,from = 1) #produces desired results
seq(10,1) #produces reversed sequence
```

## Packages

Most of the R functionalities are contained in distinct modules called <b>packages</b>. When R is installed, a small set of packages is also installed. For example, the Base R package contains the basic functions which let R function as a language: arithmetic, input/output, basic programming support, etc.. However, a large number of packages exist that contain specialized functions that will help you to achieve specific tasks. To access the functions outside the scope of the pre-installed packages, you have to install the package first using the ```install.packages()```-function. For example, to install the ggplot2 package to create graphics, type in ```install.packages("ggplot2")```. Note that you only have to install a package once. After you have installed a package, you may load it to access its functionalities using the ```library()```-function. E.g., to load the ggplot2-package, type in ```library(ggplot2)```. 

The number of R packages is rapidly increasing and there are many specialized packages to perform different types of analytics.

The video below provides a more in-depth discussion of packages, their installation and keeping them up to date.

## A typical R session

1. Open RStudio. The following video offers an introduction to the RStudio user interface:

<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

2. Make sure that your <b>working directory</b> is set correctly. The working directory is the location where R will look for files you would like to load and where any files you write to disk will be saved. If you open an existing R script from a specific folder, this folder will, by default, be the working directory. You can check your working directory by using the ```getwd()```-function. In case you wish to change your working directory, you can use the ```setwd()```-function and specify the desired location (i.e., ```setwd(path_to_project_folder)```). Notice that you have to use ```/``` instead of ```\``` to specify the path (i.e., Windows paths copied from the explorer will not work before you change the backward slashes with forward slashes). Alternatively, you can set the working directory with R-Studio by clicking on the "Sessions" tab and selecting "Set Working Directory".

3. Load your data that you wish to analyze (using procedures that we will cover later) 

4. Perform statistical analysis on your data (using methods that we will cover later)

5. Save your <b>workspace</b>. The R workspace is your current working environment incl. any user-defined objects (e.g., data frames, functions). You can save an image of the current workspace to a file called ”.RData”. In fact, RStudio will ask you automatically if you would like to save the workspace when you close the program at the end of the session. In addition, you may save an image of the workspace at any time during the session using the ```save.image()```-function. This saves the workspace image to the current working directory. When you re-open R from that working directory, the workspace will be loaded, and all these things will be available to you again. You may also save the image to any other location by specifying the path to the folder explicitly (i.e., ```save.image(path_to_project_folder)```). If you open R from a different location, you may load the workspace manually using the ```load("")```-function which points to the image file in the respective directory (e.g., ```load("path_to_project_folder/.RData")```. However, saving your workspace is not always required. Especially when you save your work in an R script file (which is highly recommended), you will be able to restore your latest results by simply executing the code contained therein again. This also prevents you from carrying over potential mistakes from one session to the next.

# Data handling

This chapter covers the basics of data handling in R

## Basic data handling

[You can download the corresponding R-Code here](./Code/01-basic_data_handling (1).R)

### Creating objects

Anything created in R is an object. You can assign values to objects using the assignment operator ``` <-```:

```{r}
x <- "hello world" #assigns the words "hello world" to the object x
#this is a comment
```

Note that comments may be included in the code after a ```#```. The text after ```#``` is not evaluated when the code is run; they can be written directly after the code or in a separate line.

To see the value of an object, simply type its name into the console and hit enter:

```{r}
x #print the value of x to the console
```

You can also explicitly tell R to print the value of an object:

```{r}
print(x) #print the value of x to the console
```

Note that because we assign characters in this case (as opposed to e.g., numeric values), we need to wrap the words in quotation marks, which must always come in pairs. Although RStudio automatically adds a pair of quotation marks (i.e., opening and closing marks) when you enter the opening marks it could be that you end up with a mismatch by accident (e.g., ```x <- "hello```). In this case, R will show you the continuation character “+”. The same could happen if you did not execute the full command by accident. The "+" means that R is expecting more input. If this happens, either add the missing pair, or press ESCAPE to abort the expression and try again.

To change the value of an object, you can simply overwrite the previous value. For example, you could also assign a numeric value to "x" to perform some basic operations: 

```{r}
x <- 2 #assigns the value of 2 to the object x
print(x)
x == 2  #checks whether the value of x is equal to 2
x != 3  #checks whether the value of x is NOT equal to 3
x < 3   #checks whether the value of x is less than 3
x > 3   #checks whether the value of x is greater than 3
```

Note that the name of the object is completely arbitrary. We could also define a second object "y", assign it a different value and use it to perform some basic mathematical operations:

```{r}
y <- 5 #assigns the value of 2 to the object x
x == y #checks whether the value of x to the value of y
x*y #multiplication of x and y
x + y #adds the values of x and y together
y^2 + 3*x #adds the value of y squared and 3x the value of x together
```

<b>Object names</b>

Please note that object names must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, as well as the ```.```, and ```_``` separators. It is important to give your objects descriptive names and to be as consistent as possible with the naming structure. In this tutorial we will be using lower case words separated by underscores (e.g., ```object_name```). There are other naming conventions, such as using a ```.``` as a separator (e.g., ```object.name```), or using upper case letters (```objectName```). It doesn't really matter which one you choose, as long as you are consistent.

### Data types

The most important types of data are:


Data type	 | Description	 
------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numeric | Approximations of the real numbers,  $\normalsize\mathbb{R}$ (e.g., mileage a car gets: 23.6, 20.9, etc.)
Integer  | Whole numbers,  $\normalsize\mathbb{Z}$ (e.g., number of sales: 7, 0, 120, 63, etc.)
Character | Text data (strings, e.g., product names)
Factor  | Categorical data for classification (e.g., product groups)
Logical  | TRUE, FALSE
Date  | Date variables (e.g., sales dates: 21-06-2015, 06-21-15, 21-Jun-2015, etc.)

Variables can be converted from one type to another using the appropriate functions (e.g., ```as.numeric()```,```as.integer()```,```as.character()```, ```as.factor()```,```as.logical()```, ```as.Date()```). For example, we could convert the object ```y``` to character as follows:

```{r}
y <- as.character(y)
print(y)
```

Notice how the value is in quotation marks since it is now of type character. 

Entering a vector of data into R can be done with the ``` c(x1,x2,..,x_n)``` ("concatenate") command. In order to be able to use our vector (or any other variable) later on we want to assign it a name using the assignment operator ``` <-```. You can choose names arbitrarily (but the first character of a name cannot be a number). Just make sure they are descriptive and unique. Assigning the same name to two variables (e.g. vectors) will result in deletion of the first. Instead of converting a variable we can also create a new one and use an existing one as input. In this case we ommit the ```as.``` and simply use the name of the type (e.g. ```factor()```). There is a subtle difference between the two: When converting a variable, with e.g. ```as.factor()```, we can only pass the variable we want to convert without additional arguments and R determines the factor levels by the existing unique values in the variable or just returns the variable itself if it is a factor already. When we specifically create a variable (just ```factor()```, ```matrix()```, etc.), we can and should set the options of this type explicitly. For a factor variable these could be the labels and levels, for a matrix the number of rows and columns and so on.  

```{r }
#Numeric:
top10_track_streams <- c(163608, 126687, 120480, 110022, 108630, 95639, 94690, 89011, 87869, 85599) 

#Character:
top10_artist_names <- c("Axwell /\\ Ingrosso", "Imagine Dragons", "J. Balvin", "Robin Schulz", "Jonas Blue", "David Guetta", "French Montana", "Calvin Harris", "Liam Payne", "Lauv") # Characters have to be put in ""

#Factor variable with two categories:
top10_track_explicit <- c(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0)
top10_track_explicit <- factor(top10_track_explicit, 
                               levels = 0:1, 
                               labels = c("not explicit", "explicit"))

#Factor variable with more than two categories:
top10_artist_genre <- c("Dance","Alternative","Latino","Dance","Dance","Dance","Hip-Hop/Rap","Dance","Pop","Pop")
top10_artist_genre <- as.factor(top10_artist_genre)

#Date:
top_10_track_release_date <- as.Date(c("2017-05-24", "2017-06-23", "2017-07-03", "2017-06-30", "2017-05-05", "2017-06-09", "2017-07-14", "2017-06-16", "2017-05-18", "2017-05-19"))

#Logical
top10_track_explicit_1 <- c(FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE)  
```

In order to "call" a vector we can now simply enter its name:

```{r}
top10_track_streams
```
```{r}
top_10_track_release_date
```

In order to check the type of a variable the ```class()``` function is used.

```{r}
class(top_10_track_release_date)
```

The video below gives a general overview of vectors and provides a more in-depth discussion. 

<div align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xioc33EZxgU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

### Data structures

Now let's create a table that contains the variables in columns and each observation in a row (like in SPSS or Excel). There are different data structures in R (e.g., Matrix, Vector, List, Array). In this course, we will mainly use <b>data frames</b>. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/Graphics/dataframe.JPG" alt="data types" height="320"></p>

Data frames are similar to matrices but are more flexible in the sense that they may contain different data types (e.g., numeric, character, etc.), where all values of vectors and matrices have to be of the same type (e.g. character). It is often more convenient to use characters instead of numbers (e.g. when indicating a persons sex: "F", "M" instead of 1 for female , 2 for male). Thus we would like to combine both numeric and character values while retaining the respective desired features. This is where "data frames" come into play. Data frames can have different types of data in each column. For example, we can combine the vectors created above in one data frame using ```data.frame()```. This creates a separate column for each vector, which is usually what we want (similar to SPSS or Excel).

```{r}
music_data <- data.frame(top10_track_streams, 
                         top10_artist_names, 
                         top10_track_explicit, 
                         top10_artist_genre, 
                         top_10_track_release_date, 
                         top10_track_explicit_1)
```

#### Accessing data in data frames

When entering the name of a data frame, R returns the entire data frame: 

```{r}
music_data # Returns the entire data frame
```

Hint: You may also use the ```View()```-function to view the data in a table format (like in SPSS or Excel), i.e. enter the command ```View(data)```. Note that you can achieve the same by clicking on the small table icon next to the data frame in the "Environment"-window on the right in RStudio. 

Sometimes it is convenient to return only specific values instead of the entire data frame. There are a variety of ways to identify the elements of a data frame. One easy way is to explicitly state, which rows and columns you wish to view. The general form of the command is ```data.frame[rows,columns]```. By leaving one of the arguments of ```data.frame[rows,columns]``` blank (e.g., ```data.frame[rows,]```) we tell R that we want to access either all rows or columns, respectively. Here are some examples:  

```{r}
music_data[ , 2:4] # all rows and columns 2,3,4
music_data[ ,c("top10_artist_names", "top_10_track_release_date")] # all rows and columns "top10_artist_names" and "top_10_track_release_date"
music_data[1:5, c("top10_artist_names", "top_10_track_release_date")] # rows 1 to 5 and columns "top10_artist_names"" and "top_10_track_release_date"
```

You may also create subsets of the data frame, e.g., using mathematical expressions:

```{r}
  music_data[top10_track_explicit == "explicit",] # show only tracks with explicit lyrics  
  music_data[top10_track_streams > 100000,] # show only tracks with more than 100,000 streams  
  music_data[top10_artist_names == 'Robin Schulz',] # returns all observations from artist "Robin Schulz"
  music_data[top10_track_explicit == "explicit",] # show only explicit tracks
```

The same can be achieved using the ```subset()```-function

```{r}
  subset(music_data,top10_track_explicit == "explicit") # selects subsets of observations in a data frame
  
  #creates a new data frame that only contains tracks from genre "Dance" 
  music_data_dance <- subset(music_data,top10_artist_genre == "Dance") 
  music_data_dance
  rm(music_data_dance) # removes an object from the workspace
```

You may also change the order of the variables in a data frame by using the ```order()```-function

```{r}
#Orders by genre (ascending) and streams (descending)
music_data[order(top10_artist_genre,-top10_track_streams),] 
```

#### Inspecting the content of a data frame
The ```head()``` function displays the first X elements/rows of a vector, matrix, table, data frame or function.
```{r}
head(music_data, 3) # returns the first X rows (here, the first 3 rows)
```
The ```tail()``` function is similar, except it displays the last elements/rows.
```{r}
tail(music_data, 3) # returns the last X rows (here, the last 3 rows)
```  
```names()``` returns the names of an R object. When, for example, it is called on a data frame, it returns the names of the columns. 
```{r}
names(music_data) # returns the names of the variables in the data frame
```
```str()``` displays the internal structure of an R object. In the case of a data frame, it returns the class (e.g., numeric, factor, etc.) of each variable, as well as the number of observations and the number of variables. 
```{r}
str(music_data) # returns the structure of the data frame
```
```nrow()``` and ```ncol()``` return the rows and columns of a data frame or matrix, respectively. ```dim()``` displays the dimensions of an R object.
```{r}
nrow(music_data) # returns the number of rows 
ncol(music_data) # returns the number of columns 
dim(music_data) # returns the dimensions of a data frame
```
```ls()``` can be used to list all objects that are associated with an R object. 
```{r}
ls(music_data) # list all objects associated with an object
```

#### Append and delete variables to/from data frames

To call a certain column in a data frame, we may also use the ```$``` notation. For example, this returns all values associated with the variable "top10_track_streams":
  
```{r}
music_data$top10_track_streams
```

Assume that you wanted to add an additional variable to the data frame. You may use the ```$``` notation to achieve this:

```{r}
# Create new variable as the log of the number of streams 
music_data$log_streams <- log(music_data$top10_track_streams) 
# Create an ascending count variable which might serve as an ID
music_data$obs_number <- 1:nrow(music_data)
head(music_data)
```

To delete a variable, you can simply create a ```subset``` of the full data frame that excludes the variables that you wish to drop:

```{r}
music_data <- subset(music_data,select = -c(log_streams)) # deletes the variable log streams 
head(music_data)
```

You can also rename variables in a data frame, e.g., using the ```rename()```-function from the ```plyr``` package. In the following code "::" signifies that the function "rename" should be taken from the package "plyr". This can be useful if multiple packages have a function with the same name. Calling a function this way also means that you can access a function without loading the entire package via ```library()```.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plyr)
music_data <- plyr::rename(music_data, c(top10_artist_genre="genre",top_10_track_release_date="release_date"))
head(music_data)
```

Note that the same can be achieved using:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
names(music_data)[names(music_data)=="genre"] <- "top10_artist_genre"
head(music_data)
```

Or by referring to the index of the variable:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
names(music_data)[4] <- "genre"
head(music_data)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
options(scipen = F)
#This code automatically tidies code so that it does not reach over the page
opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=50),tidy=FALSE, rownames.print = FALSE, rows.print = 10, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)


top10_track_streams <- c(163608, 126687, 120480, 110022, 108630, 95639, 94690, 89011, 87869, 85599) 
top10_artist_names <- c("Axwell /\\ Ingrosso", "Imagine Dragons", "J. Balvin", "Robin Schulz", "Jonas Blue", "David Guetta", "French Montana", "Calvin Harris", "Liam Payne", "Lauv") # Characters have to be put in ""
top10_track_explicit <- c(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0)
top10_track_explicit <- factor(top10_track_explicit, 
                               levels = 0:1, 
                               labels = c("not explicit", "explicit"))
top10_artist_genre <- c("Dance","Alternative","Latino","Dance","Dance","Dance","Hip-Hop/Rap","Dance","Pop","Pop")
top10_artist_genre <- as.factor(top10_artist_genre)
top_10_track_release_date <- as.Date(c("2017-05-24", "2017-06-23", "2017-07-03", "2017-06-30", "2017-05-05", "2017-06-09", "2017-07-14", "2017-06-16", "2017-05-18", "2017-05-19"))
top10_track_explicit_1 <- c(FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE)  

music_data <- data.frame(top10_track_streams, 
                         top10_artist_names, 
                         top10_track_explicit, 
                         top10_artist_genre, 
                         top_10_track_release_date, 
                         top10_track_explicit_1,
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

```

Before you can start your analysis in R, you first need to import the data you wish to perform the analysis on. You will often be faced with different types of data formats (usually produced by some other statistical software like SPSS or Excel or a text editor). Fortunately, R is fairly flexible with respect to the sources from which data may be imported and you can import the most common data formats into R with the help of a few packages. R can, among others, handle data from the following sources: 

![](https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/Graphics/data_import.JPG)

In the previous chapter, we saw how we may use the keyboard to input data in R. In the following sections, we will learn how to import data from text files and other statistical software packages. 

### Getting data for this course

Most of the data sets we will be working with in this course will be stored in text files (i.e., .dat, .txt, .csv). There are two ways for you to obtain access to the data sets:

[You can download the corresponding R-Code here](./Code/03-data_import (2).R)


#### Directly import datasets from GitHub (recommended)

All data sets we will be working with are stored in a repository on GitHub (similar to other cloud storage services such as Dropbox). If you know the location, where the files are stored, you may conveniently load the data directly from GitHub into R using the ```read.table()``` function. The ```header=TRUE``` argument indicates that the first line of data represents the header, i.e., it contains the names of the columns. The ```sep="\t"```-argument specifies the delimiter (the character used to separate the columns), which is a TAB in this case.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

test_data <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/master/MRDA2017/test_data.dat", 
                        sep = "\t", 
                        header = TRUE)
```


#### Download and import datasets from "Learn\@WU"

It is also possible to download the data from the respective folder on the "Learn\@WU" platform, placing it in the working directory and importing it from there. However, this requires an additional step to download the file manually first. If you chose this option, please **remember to put the data file in the working directory first**. If the import is not working, check your working directory setting using ```getwd()```. Once you placed the file in the working directory, you can import it using the same command as above. Note that the file must be given as a character string (i.e., in quotation marks) and has to end with the file extension (e.g., .csv, .tsv, etc.).

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
music_data <- read.table("music.data.extension", header=TRUE)
```

### Import data created by other software packages

Sometimes, you may need to import data files created by other software packages, such as Excel or SPSS. In this section we will use the ```readxl``` and ```haven``` packages to do this. To import a certain file you should first make sure that the file is stored in your current working directory. You can list all file names in your working directory using the ```list.files()``` function. If the file is not there, either copy it to your current working directory, or set your working directory to the folder where the file is located using ```setwd("/path/to/file")```. This tells R the folder you are working in. Remember that you have to use ```/``` instead of ```\``` to specify the path (if you use Windows paths copied from the explorer they will not work). When your file is in your working directory you can simply enter the filename into the respective import command. The import commands offer various options. For more details enter ```?read_excel```, ```?read_spss``` after loading the packages.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files() #lists all files in the current working directory
#setwd("/path/to/file") #may be used to change the working directory to the folder that contains the desired file

#import excel files
library(readxl) #load package to import Excel files
excel_sheets("music_data.xlsx")
music_data_excel <- read_excel("music_data.xlsx", sheet = "mrda_2016_survey") # "sheet=x"" specifies which sheet to import
head(music_data_excel)

library(haven) #load package to import SPSS files
#import SPSS files
music_data_spss <- read_sav("music_data.sav")
head(music_data_spss)
```

The import of other file formats works in a very similar way (e.g., Stata, SAS). Please refer to the respective help-files (e.g., ```?read_dta```, ```?read_sas``` ...) if you wish to import data created by other software packages. 

### Export data

Exporting to different formats is also easy, as you can just replace "read" with "write" in many of the previously discussed functions (e.g. ```write.table(object, "file_name")```). This will save the data file to the working directory. To check what the current working directory is you can use ```getwd()```. By default, the ```write.table(object, "file_name")```function includes the row number as the first variable. By specifying ```row.names = FALSE```, you may exclude this variable since it doesn't contain any useful information.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
write.table(music_data, "musicData.dat", row.names = FALSE, sep = "\t") #writes to a tab-delimited text file
write.table(music_data, "musicData.csv", row.names = FALSE, sep = ",") #writes to a comma-separated value file 
write_sav(music_data, "my_file.sav")
```

### Import data from the Web

#### Scraping data from websites

Sometimes you may come across interesting data on websites that you would like to analyse. Reading data from websites is possible in R, e.g., using the ```rvest``` package. Let's assume you would like to read a table that lists the population of different countries from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population" target="_blank">this Wikipedia page</a>. It helps to first inspect the structure of the website (e.g., using tools like <a href="http://selectorgadget.com/" target="_blank">SelectorGadget</a>), so you know which elements you would like to extract. In this case it is fairly obvious that the data are stored in a table for which the associated html-tag is ```<table>```. So let's read the entire website using ```read_html(url)``` and filter all tables using ```read_html(html_nodes(...,"table"))```.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rvest)
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population"
population <- read_html(url) 
population <- html_nodes(population, "table.wikitable")
print(population)
```

The output shows that there are two tables on the website and the first one appears to contain the relevant information. So let's read the first table using the  ```html_table()``` function. Note that ```population``` is of class "list". A list is a vector that has other R objects (e.g., other vectors, data frames, matrices, etc.) as its elements. If we want to access the data of one of the elements, we have to use two square brackets on each side instead of just one (e.g., ```population[[1]]``` gets us the first table from the list of tables on the website; the argument ```fill = TRUE``` ensures that empty cells are replaced with missing values when reading the table).

```{r}
population <- population[[1]] %>% html_table(fill = TRUE)
head(population) #checks if we scraped the desired data
```

You can see that population is read as a character variable because of the commas. 

```{r}
class(population$Population)
```

If we wanted to use this variable for some kind of analysis, we would first need to convert it to numeric format using the ```as.numeric()``` function. However, before we can do this, we can use the ```str_replace_all()``` function from the stringr package, which replaces all matches of a string. In our case, we would like to replace the commas (```","```) with nothing (```""```).

```{r}
library(stringr)
population$Population <- as.numeric(str_replace_all(population$Population, pattern = ",", replacement = "")) #convert to numeric
head(population) #checks if we scraped the desired data
```

Now the variable is of type "numeric" and could be used for analysis.

```{r}
class(population$Population)
```

#### Scraping data from APIs

##### Scraping data from APIs directly

Reading data from websites can be tricky since you need to analyze the page structure first. Many web-services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) actually have application programming interfaces (API's), which you can use to obtain data in a pre-structured format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular lightweight data-interchange format in which data can be obtained. The process of obtaining data is visualized in the following graphic:

![Obtaining data from APIs](https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/API.JPG)

The process of obtaining data from APIs consists of the following steps:

* Identify an API that has enough data to be relevant and reliable (e.g., <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com:" target="_blank">www.programmableweb.com</a> has >12,000 open web APIs in 63 categories).
* Request information by calling (or, more technically speaking, creating a request to) the API (e.g., R, python, php or JavaScript).
* Receive response messages, which is usually in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or Extensible Markup Language (XML) format.
* Write a parser to pull out the elements you want and put them into a of simpler format
* Store, process or analyze data according the marketing research question.

Let's assume that you would like to obtain population data again. The World Bank has an API that allows you to easily obtain this kind of data. The details are usually provided in the API reference, e.g., <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-api-documentation" target="_blank">here</a>. You simply "call" the API for the desired information and get a structured JSON file with the desired key-value pairs in return. For example, the population for Austria from 1960 to 2016 can be obtained using <a href="http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AT/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL/?date=1960:2016&format=json&per_page=100" target="_blank">this call</a>. The file can be easily read into R using the ```fromJSON()```-function from the ```jsonlite```-package. Again, the result is a list and the second element ```ctrydata[[2]]``` contains the desired data, from which we select the "value" and "data" columns using the square brackets as usual ```[,c("value","date")]```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
url <- "http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AT/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL/?date=1960:2016&format=json&per_page=100" #specifies url
ctrydata <- fromJSON(url) #parses the data 
str(ctrydata)
head(ctrydata[[2]][,c("value","date")]) #checks if we scraped the desired data
```    

##### Scraping data from APIs via R packages

An even more convenient way to obtain data from web APIs is to use existing R packages that someone else has already created. There are R packages available for various web-services. For example, the ```gtrendsR``` package can be used to conveniently obtain data from the <a href="https://trends.google.at/trends/" target="_blank">Google Trends</a> page. The ```gtrends()``` function is easy to use and returns a list of elements (e.g., "interest over time", "interest by city", "related topics"), which can be inspected using the ```ls()``` function. The following example can be used to obtain data for the search term "data science" in the US between September 1 and October 6: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
library(gtrendsR)
index = 1
success = FALSE
while(!(success | index == 10)){
  google_trends <- try(gtrends("data science", geo = c("US"), gprop = c("web"), time = "2017-09-01 2017-10-06"), silent = TRUE)
  
  if(!is(google_trends, "try-error")){
    ls(google_trends)
    head(google_trends$interest_over_time)
    success = TRUE
  }else{
  index = index + 1
  Sys.sleep(runif(1,0,3))}
}
if(success == FALSE){
  warning("Google Trends has exited unsuccessfully")
}
```

## Summarizing data

### Summary statistics

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
options(scipen = 999)
#This code automatically tidies code so that it does not reach over the page
opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=50),tidy=TRUE, rownames.print = FALSE, rows.print = 10)
opts_chunk$set(cache=T)
```

This section discusses how to produce and analyse basic summary statistics. We make a distinction between categorical and continuous variables, for which different statistics are permissible.

[You can download the corresponding R-Code here](./Code/04-basic_statistics (1).R)

As an example data set, we will be using the Spotify music data. Let's load and inspect the data first. Students of the course can get the data via Learn\@WU. If you are not enrolled in the course please contact [Daniel Winkler](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/imsm/about-us/team/daniel-winkler) (https://www.wu.ac.at/en/imsm/about-us/team/daniel-winkler).

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(openssl)
passphrase <- charToRaw("MRDAnils")
key <- sha256(passphrase)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/mrda_data_pub/master/secret-music_data.rds"
download.file(url, "./data/secret_music_data.rds", method = "auto", quiet=FALSE)
encrypted_music_data <- readRDS("./data/secret_music_data.rds")
music_data <- unserialize(aes_cbc_decrypt(encrypted_music_data, key = key))
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
readRDS("music_data.rds")
```
### Categorical variables

Categorical variables contain a finite number of categories or distinct groups and are also known as qualitative variables. There are different types of categorical variables:

* **Nominal variables**: variables that have two or more categories but no logical order (e.g., music genres). A dichotomous variables is simply a nominal variable that only has two categories (e.g., gender).
* **Ordinal variables**: variables that have two or more categories that can also be ordered or ranked (e.g., income groups).

For this example, we are interested in the following two variables

* "genre": the music genre the song is associated with, subsetted for the most frequent genres.  
* "explicit": whether the lyrics of the tracks are explicit or not (0 = not explicit, 1 = explicit)

[You can find a full description of the variables here:](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/personalization/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks/) 

In a first step, we convert the variables to factor variables using the ```factor()``` function to assign appropriate labels according to the scale points:

```{r}
s.genre <- c("pop","hip hop","rock","rap","indie")
music_data <- subset(music_data, top.genre %in% s.genre)

music_data$genre_cat <- as.factor(music_data$top.genre)
music_data$explicit_cat <- factor(music_data$explicit, levels = c(0:1), 
    labels = c("not explicit", "explicit"))
```

The ```table()``` function creates a frequency table. Let's start with the number of occurrences of the categories associated with the genre and explicitness variables separately:

```{r}
table(music_data[,c("genre_cat")]) #absolute frequencies
table(music_data[,c("explicit_cat")]) #absolute frequencies
```

It is obvious that there are more tracks with non-explicit lyrics than songs with explicit lyrics. For variables with more categories, it might be less obvious and we might use the ```summary()``` function, which produces further statistics. 

```{r}
summary(music_data$explicit)
```

Often, we are interested in the relative frequencies, which can be obtained by using the ```prop.table()``` function.

```{r}
prop.table(table(music_data[,c("genre_cat")])) #relative frequencies
prop.table(table(music_data[,c("explicit_cat")])) #relative frequencies
```

Now let's investigate if the genre differs by expliciteness. To do this, we simply apply the ```table()``` function to both variables:

```{r}
table(music_data[,c("genre_cat", "explicit_cat")]) #absolute frequencies
```

Again, it might be more meaningful to look at the relative frequencies using ```prop.table()```:

```{r}
prop.table(table(music_data[,c("genre_cat", "explicit_cat")])) #relative frequencies
```

Note that the above output shows the overall relative frequencies when explicit and non-explicit songs are considered together. In this context, it might be even more meaningful to look at the conditional relative frequencies. This can be achieved by adding a ```,2``` to the ```prop.table()``` command, which tells R to compute the relative frequencies by the columns (which is in our case the explicitness variable): 

```{r}
prop.table(table(music_data[,c("genre_cat", "explicit_cat")]),2) #conditional relative frequencies
```

### Continuous variables

#### Descriptive statistics

Continuous variables are numeric variables that can take on any value on a measurement scale (i.e., there is an infinite number of values between any two values). There are different types of continuous variables:

* **Interval variables**: while the zero point is arbitrary, equal intervals on the scale represent equal differences in the property being measured. E.g., on a temperature scale measured in Celsius the difference between a temperature of 15 degrees and 25 degrees is the same difference as between 25 degrees and 35 degrees but the zero point is arbitrary. 
* **Ratio variables**: has all the properties of an interval variable, but also has an absolute zero point. When the variable equals 0.0, it means that there is none of that variable (e.g., number of products sold, willingness-to-pay, mileage a car gets). 

Computing descriptive statistics in R is easy and there are many functions from different packages that let you calculate summary statistics (including the ```summary()``` function from the ```base``` package). In this tutorial, we will use the ```describe()``` function from the ```psych``` package:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
library(psych)
psych::describe(music_data[,c("trackPopularity", "adv_spending")])
```

In the above command, we used the ```psych::``` prefix to avoid confusion and to make sure that R uses the ```describe()``` function from the ```psych``` package since there are many other packages that also contain a ```desribe()``` function. Note that you could also compute these statistics separately by using the respective functions (e.g., ```mean()```, ```sd()```, ```median()```, ```min()```, ```max()```, etc.). 

The ```psych``` package also contains the ```describeBy()``` function, which lets you compute the summary statistics by sub-group separately. For example, we could easily compute the summary statistics by expliciteness as follows: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
describeBy(music_data[,c("trackPopularity", "adv_spending")], music_data$explicit_cat)
```

Note that you could just as well use other packages to compute the descriptive statistics. For example, you could have used the ```stat.desc()``` function from the ```pastecs``` package:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
library(pastecs)
stat.desc(music_data[,c("trackPopularity", "adv_spending")])
```

Computing statistics by group is also possible by using the wrapper function ```by()```. Within the function, you first specify the data on which you would like to perform the grouping ```music_data[,c("trackPopularity", "adv_spending")]```, followed by the grouping variable ```music_data$explicit_cat``` and the function that you would like to execute (e.g., ```stat.desc()```):

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
library(pastecs)
by(music_data[,c("trackPopularity", "adv_spending")],music_data$explicit_cat,stat.desc)
```

These examples are meant to exemplify that there are often many different ways to reach a goal in R. Which one you choose depends on what type of information you seek (the results provide slightly different information) and on personal preferences.

#### Creating subsets

From the above statistics it is clear that the data set contains some severe outliers on some variables. For example, the maximum amount of spending on advertisment is `r round(max(na.omit(music_data$adv_spending)),1)` units. You might want to investigate these cases and delete them if they would turn out to indeed induce a bias in your analyses. For normally distributed data, any absolute standardized deviations larger than 3 standard deviations from the mean are suspicious. Let's check if potential outliers exist in the data:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
music_data %>% mutate(adv_spending_std = as.vector(scale(adv_spending))) %>% filter(abs(adv_spending_std) > 3) %>% select(id, trackName, adv_spending, adv_spending_std)
```

Indeed, there appear to be two potential outliers, which we may wish to exclude before we start fitting models to the data. You could easily create a subset of the original data, which you would then use for estimation using the ```filter()``` function from the ```dplyr()``` package. For example, the following code creates a subset that excludes all cases with a standardized duration of more than 3: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
estimation_sample <- music_data %>% mutate(adv_spending_std = as.vector(scale(adv_spending))) %>% filter(abs(adv_spending_std) < 3)
psych::describe(estimation_sample[,c("trackPopularity", "adv_spending")])
```

## Data visualization

This section discusses how to produce appropriate graphics to describe our data visually. While R includes tools to build plots, we will be using the ggplot2 package by Hadley Wickham. It has the advantage of being fairly straightforward to learn but being very flexible when it comes to building more complex plots. For a more in depth discussion you can refer to chapter 4 of the book "Discovering Statistics Using R" by Andy Field et al. or read the following chapter from the book <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html" target="_blank">"R for Data science"</a> by Hadley Wickham as well as <a href="https://r-graphics.org/" target="_blank">"R Graphics Cookbook"</a> by Winston Chang.

ggplot2 is built around the idea of constructing plots by stacking layers on top of one another. Every plot starts with the ```ggplot(data)``` function, after which layers can be added with the "+" symbol. The following figures show the layered structure of creating plots with ggplot.

### Categorical variables

#### Bar plot

To give you an example of how the graphics are composed, let's go back to the frequency table from the previous chapter, where we created this table:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(openssl)
passphrase <- charToRaw("MRDAnils")
key <- sha256(passphrase)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/mrda_data_pub/master/secret-music_data.rds"
download.file(url, "./data/secret_music_data.rds", method = "auto", quiet=FALSE)
encrypted_music_data <- readRDS("./data/secret_music_data.rds")
music_data <- unserialize(aes_cbc_decrypt(encrypted_music_data, key = key))
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
readRDS("music_data.rds")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
s.genre <- c("pop","hip hop","rock","rap","indie")
music_data <- subset(music_data, top.genre %in% s.genre)

music_data$genre_cat <- as.factor(music_data$top.genre)
music_data$explicit_cat <- factor(music_data$explicit, levels = c(0:1), 
    labels = c("not explicit", "explicit"))

head(music_data)
```

How can we plot this kind of data? Since we have a categorical variable, we will use a bar plot. However, to be able to use the table for your plot, you first need to assign it to an object as a data frame using the ```as.data.frame()```-function.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table_plot_rel <- as.data.frame(prop.table(table(music_data[,c("genre_cat")]))) #relative frequencies #relative frequencies
head(table_plot_rel)
```

Since ```Var1``` is not a very descriptive name, let's rename the variable to something more meaningful

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plyr)
table_plot_rel <- plyr::rename(table_plot_rel, c(Var1="Genre"))
head(table_plot_rel)
```

Once we have our data set we can begin constructing the plot. As mentioned previously, we start with the ```ggplot()``` function, with the argument specifying the data set to be used. Within the function, we further specify the scales to be used using the aesthetics argument, specifying which variable should be plotted on which axis. In our example, we would like to plot the categories on the x-axis (horizontal axis) and the relative frequencies on the y-axis (vertical axis). 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (step 1)"}
library(ggplot2)
bar_chart <- ggplot(table_plot_rel, aes(x = Genre,y = Freq))
bar_chart
```

You can see that the coordinate system is empty. This is because so far, we have told R merely which variables we would like to plot but we haven't specified which geometric figures (points, bars, lines, etc.) we would like to use. This is done using the ```geom_xxx``` function. ggplot includes many different geoms, for a wide range of plots (e.g., geom_line, geom_histogram, geom_boxplot, etc.). A good overview of the various geom functions can be found <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. In our case, we would like to use a bar chart for which ```geom_col``` is appropriate.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (step 2)"}
bar_chart + geom_col() 
```

Note that the same could be achieved using ```geom_bar```. However, by default ```geom_bar``` counts the number of observations within each category of a variable. This is not required in our case because we have already used the ```prop.table()``` function to compute the relative frequencies. The argument ```stat = "identity"``` prevents ```geom_bar``` from performing counting operations and uses it "as it is".   

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (alternative specification)"}
bar_chart + geom_bar(stat = "identity") 
```

Now we have specified the data, the scales and the shape. Specifying this information is essential for plotting data using ggplot. Everything that follows now just serves the purpose of making the plot look nicer by modifying the appearance of the plot. How about some more meaningful axis labels? We can specify the axis labels using the ```ylab()``` and ```xlab()``` functions:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (step 3)"}
bar_chart + geom_col() +
  ylab("Relative frequency") + 
  xlab("Genre") 
```

How about adding some value labels to the bars? This can be done using ```geom_text()```. Note that the ```sprintf()``` function is not mandatory and is only added to format the numeric labels here. The function takes two arguments: the first specifies the format wrapped in two ```%``` sings. Thus, ```%.0f``` means to format the value as a fixed point value with no digits after the decimal point, and ```%%``` is a literal that prints a "%" sign. The second argument is simply the numeric value to be used. In this case, the relative frequencies multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage values. Using the ```vjust = ``` argument, we can adjust the vertical alignment of the label. In this case, we would like to display the label slightly above the bars.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (step 4)"}
bar_chart + geom_col() +
  ylab("Relative frequency") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.0f%%", Freq/sum(Freq) * 100)), vjust=-0.2) 
```

We could go ahead and specify the appearance of every single element of the plot now. However, there are also pre-specified themes that include various formatting steps in one singe function. For example ```theme_bw()``` would make the plot appear like this: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (step 5)"}
bar_chart + geom_col() +
  ylab("Relative frequency") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.0f%%", Freq/sum(Freq) * 100)), vjust=-0.2) +
  theme_bw()
```

and ```theme_minimal()``` looks like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (options 1)"}
bar_chart + geom_col() +
  ylab("Relative frequency") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.0f%%", Freq/sum(Freq) * 100)), vjust=-0.2) +
  theme_minimal()
```

These were examples of built-in formations of ```ggolot()```, where the default is ```theme_classic()```. For even more options, check out the ```ggthemes``` package, which includes formats for specific publications. You can check out the different themes <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html" target="_blank">here</a>. For example ```theme_economist()``` uses the formatting of the journal "The Economist":

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Bar chart (options 2)"}
library(ggthemes)
bar_chart + geom_col() +
  ylab("Relative frequency") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  theme_economist()
```

**Summary**

To create a plot with ggplot we give it the appropriate data (in the ```ggplot()``` function), tell it which shape to use (via a function of the geom family), assign variables to the correct axis (by using the the ```aes()``` function) and define the appearance of the plot.

Now we would like to investigate whether the distribution differs between explicit and non-explicit songs. For this purpose we first construct the conditional relative frequency table from the previous chapter again. Recall that the latter gives us the relative frequency within a group (in our case explicit and non-explicit), as compared to the relative frequency within the entire sample. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table_plot_cond_rel <- as.data.frame(prop.table(table(music_data[,c("genre_cat", "explicit_cat")]),2)) #conditional relative frequencies
```

We can now take these tables to construct plots grouped by explicitness. To achieve this we simply need to add  the ```facet_wrap()``` function, which replicates a plot multiple times, split by a specified grouping factor. Note that the grouping factor has to be supplied in R's formula notation, hence it is preceded by a "~" symbol. 

```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Grouped bar chart (conditional relative frequencies)"}
ggplot(table_plot_cond_rel, aes(x = genre_cat, y = Freq)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~ explicit_cat) + 
  ylab("Conditional relative frequency") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  theme_bw() 
```

To plot the relative frequencies for each response category by group in a slightly different way, we can also use the ```fill``` argument, which tells ggplot to fill the bars by a specified variable (in our case "explicit"). The ```position = "dodge"``` argument causes the bars to be displayed next to each other (as opposed to stacked on top of one another).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Grouped bar chart (conditional relative frequencies) (2)"}
ggplot(table_plot_cond_rel, aes(x = genre_cat, y = Freq, fill = explicit_cat)) + #use "fill" argument for different colors
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + #use "dodge" to display bars next to each other (instead of stacked on top)
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%.0f%%", Freq/sum(Freq) * 100)),position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
  ylab("Conditional relative frequency") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  theme_bw() 
```

#### Covariation plots

To visualize the covariation between categorical variables, you’ll need to count the number of observations for each combination stored in the frequency table. Say, we wanted to investigate the association between genre and popularity. First, we need to make sure that the respective variables are coded as factors. 


```{r}
music_data$genre_cat <- as.factor(music_data$top.genre)

music_data$popularity_factor <- cut(music_data$trackPopularity, 
                   breaks=c(-Inf, 40, 60, Inf), 
                   labels=c("low","middle","high"))
```

There are multiple ways to visualize such a relationship with ggplot. One option would be to use a variation of the scatterplot which counts how many points overlap at any given point and increases the dot size accordingly. This can be achieved with ```geom_count()```. From the bar charts above, we know that the categories in `genre` differ in size. To account for that we set the parameters `size` and `group` in `geom_count`, which gives us the conditional relative frequencies. This is equivalent to the conditional relative frequency table from above, only now the `stat(prop)` argument assures that we get relative frequencies and with the `group` argument we tell R to compute the relative frequencies by genre.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Covariation between categorical data (1)"}
ggplot(data = music_data) + 
  geom_count(aes(x = genre_cat, y = popularity_factor, size = stat(prop), group = genre_cat))  + 
  ylab("Popularity") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  labs(size = "Proportion") +
  theme_bw()
```

Another option would be to use a tile plot that changes the color of the tile based on the frequency of the combination of factors. To achieve this we first have to create a dataframe that contains the relative frequencies of all combinations of factors. Then we can take this dataframe and supply it to ```geom_tile()```, while specifying that the fill of each tile should be dependent on the observed frequency of the factor combination, which is done by specifying the fill in the ```aes()``` function.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Covariation between categorical data (2)"}
table_plot_rel <- prop.table(table(music_data[,c("genre_cat", "popularity_factor")]),1)
table_plot_rel <- as.data.frame(table_plot_rel)

ggplot(table_plot_rel, aes(x = genre_cat, y = popularity_factor)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq)) + 
  ylab("Popularity") + 
  xlab("Genre") + 
  theme_bw()
```

### Continuous variables

#### Histogram

Histograms can be plotted for continuous data using the ```geom_histogram()``` function. Note that the ```aes()``` function only needs one argument here, since a histogram is a plot of the distribution of only one variable. As an example, let's consider our data set containing the advertising expenditures and product sales of a company selling products in two different stores: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Histogram"}

head(music_data)
```

Now we can create the histogram using ```geom_histogram()```. The argument ```binwidth``` specifies the range that each bar spans, ```col = "black"``` specifies the border to be black and ```fill = "darkblue"``` sets the inner color of the bars to dark blue. For brevity, we have now also started naming the x and y axis with the single function ```labs()```, instead of using the two distinct functions ```xlab()``` and ```ylab()```.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Histogram"}
ggplot(music_data,aes(mstreams)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3000, col = "black", fill = "darkblue") + 
  labs(x = "Number of streams", y = "Frequency") + 
  theme_bw()
```

#### Boxplot

Another common way to display the distribution of continuous variables is through boxplots. ggplot will construct a boxplot if given the geom ```geom_boxplot()```. In our case we want to show the difference in distribution between the two stores in our sample, which is why the ```aes()``` function contains both an x and a y variable. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Boxplot by group"}
ggplot(music_data,aes(x = explicit_cat, y = mstreams)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 3) + 
  labs(x = "Explicit", y = "Number of streams") + 
  theme_bw()
```

The following graphic shows you how to interpret the boxplot:

![Information contained in a Boxplot](https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/boxplot.JPG)

You may also augment the boxplot with the data points using ```geom_jitter()```:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Boxplot with augmented data points"}
ggplot(music_data,aes(x = explicit_cat, y = mstreams)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 3) + 
  geom_jitter(colour="red", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Explicit", y = "Number of streams") + 
  theme_bw()
```

In case you would like to create the boxplot on the total data (i.e., not by group), just leave the ```x = ``` argument within the ```aes()``` function empty: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Single Boxplot"}
ggplot(music_data,aes(x = "", y = mstreams)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 3) + 
  labs(x = "Total", y = "Number of streams") + 
  theme_bw()
```

#### Plot of means

Another quick way to get an overview of the difference between two groups is to plot their respective means with confidence intervals. Two things about this plot are new. First, there are now two geoms included in the same plot. This is one of the big advantages of ggplot's layered approach to graphs, the fact that new elements can be drawn by simply adding a new line with a new geom function. In this case we want to add confidence bounds to our plot, which we achieve by adding a ```geom_pointrange()``` layer. Recall that if the interval is small, the sample must be very close to the population and when the interval is wide, the sample mean is likely very different from the population mean and therefore a bad representation of the population. Second, we are using an additional argument in ```geom_bar()```, namely ```stat = ```, which is short for statistical transformation. Every geom uses such a transformation in the background to adapt the data to be able to create the desired plot. ```geom_bar()``` typically uses the ```count``` stat, which would create a similar plot to the one we saw at the very beginning, counting how often a certain value of a variable appears. By telling ```geom_bar()``` explicitly that we want to use a different stat we can override its behavior, forcing it to create a bar plot of the means.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Plot of means"}
music_data2 <- music_data[music_data$duration_ms,]
ggplot(music_data,aes(explicit_cat, duration_ms)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "summary",  color = "black", fill = "white", width = 0.7, na.rm=T) +
  geom_pointrange(stat = "summary",
                  fun.ymin = function(x)mean(x) - sd(x),
                  fun.ymax = function(x)mean(x) + sd(x),
                  fun.y= mean,
                  na.rm = T) + 
  labs(x = "Explicit", y = "Average number of streams")+
  #coord_cartesian(ylim = c(100000, 150000)) +
  theme_bw()
```

#### Scatter plot

The most common way to show the relationship between two continuous variables is a scatterplot. The following code creates a scatterplot with some additional components. The ```geom_smooth()``` function creates a smoothed line from the data provided. In this particular example we tell the function to draw the best possible straight line (i.e., minimizing the distance between the line and the points) through the data (via the argument ```method = "lm"```). The "fill" and "alpha" arguments solely affect appearance, in our case the color and the opacity of the confidence interval, respectively.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Scatter plot"}
ggplot(music_data, aes(log(adv_spending), mstreams)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1) +
  labs(x = "Advertising expenditures (EUR)", y = "Number of streams") + 
  theme_bw() 
```

As you can see, there appears to be a positive relationship between advertising and sales.

##### Grouped scatter plot

It could be that customers from different store respond differently to advertising. We can visually capture such differences with a grouped scatter plot. By adding the argument ```colour = store``` to the aesthetic specification, ggplot automatically treats the two stores as distinct groups and plots accordingly. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Grouped scatter plot"}
ggplot(music_data, aes(log(adv_spending), mstreams, colour = explicit_cat)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", alpha = 0.1) + 
  labs(x = "Advertising expenditures (EUR)", y = "Number of streams", colour="Explicit") + 
  theme_bw()
```

It appears from the plot that explicit tracks are more responsive to advertising. 

##### Combination of scatter plot and histogram

Using the ```ggExtra()``` package, you may also augment the scatterplot with a histogram:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Scatter plot with histogram"}
library(ggExtra)
p <- ggplot(music_data, aes(log(adv_spending), mstreams)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Advertising expenditures (EUR)", y = "Number of strams", colour = "store") + 
  theme_bw() 
ggExtra::ggMarginal(p, type = "histogram")

```

In this case, the ```type = "histogram"``` argument specifies that we would like to plot a histogram. However, you could also opt for ```type = "boxplot"``` or ```type = "density"``` to use a boxplot or density plot instead.

#### Line plot

Another important type of plot is the line plot used if, for example, you have a variable that changes over time and you want to plot how it develops over time. To demonstrate this we first gather the population of Austria from the world bank API (as we did previously).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
#specifies url
url <- "http://api.worldbank.org/countries/AT/indicators/SP.POP.TOTL/?date=1960:2016&format=json&per_page=100" 
ctrydata_at <- fromJSON(url) #parses the data 
head(ctrydata_at[[2]][, c("value", "date")]) #checks if we scraped the desired data
ctrydata_at <- ctrydata_at[[2]][, c("date","value")]
ctrydata_at$value <- as.numeric(ctrydata_at$value)
ctrydata_at$date <- as.integer(ctrydata_at$date)
str(ctrydata_at)
```

As you can see doing this is very straightforward. Given the correct ```aes()``` and geom specification ggplot constructs the correct plot for us.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Line plot"}
ggplot(ctrydata_at, aes(x = date, y = value)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Population of Austria") +
  theme_bw()
```    

### Saving plots

To save the last displayed plot, simply use the function ```ggsave()```, and it will save the plot to your working directory. Use the arguments ```height```and ```width``` to specify the size of the file. You may also choose the file format by adjusting the ending of the file name. E.g., ```file_name.jpg``` will create a file in JPG-format, whereas ```file_name.png``` saves the file in PNG-format, etc.. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(table_plot_abs_reg, aes(x = Theory_Regression_cat, y = Practice_Regression_cat)) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Freq)) + 
  ylab("Practical knowledge") + 
  xlab("Theoretical knowledge") + 
  theme_bw()

ggsave("theory_practice_regression.jpg", height = 5, width = 7.5)
```

### Additional options

Now that we have covered the most important plots, we can look at what other type of data you may come across. One type of data that is increasingly available is the geo-location of customers and users (e.g., from app usage data). The following data set contains the app usage data of Shazam users from Germany. The data contains the latitude and longitude information where a music track was "shazamed". 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(ggmap)
library(dplyr)
geo_data <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/master/MRDA2017/geo_data.dat", 
                       sep = "\t", 
                       header = TRUE)
head(geo_data)
```

There is a package called "ggmap", which is an augmentation for the ggplot packages. It lets you load maps from different web services (e.g., Google maps) and maps the user location within the coordination system of ggplot. With this information, you can create interesting plots like heat maps. We won't go into detail here but you may go through the following code on your own if you are interested. However, please note that you need to register an API with Google in order to make use of this package. 

```{r ggmaps, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#register_google(key = "your_api_key")

# Download the base map
de_map_g_str <- get_map(location=c(10.018343,51.133481), zoom=6, scale=2) # results in below map (wohoo!)

# Draw the heat map
ggmap(de_map_g_str, extent = "device") + 
  geom_density2d(data = geo_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat), size = 0.3) + 
  stat_density2d(data = geo_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fill = ..level.., alpha = ..level..), 
                 size = 0.01, bins = 16, geom = "polygon") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "green", high = "red") + 
  scale_alpha(range = c(0, 0.3), guide = FALSE)

```

### Text and Equations

R-Markdown documents are plain text files that include both text and R-code. Using RStudio they can be converted ('knitted') to HTML or PDF files that include both the text and the results of the R-code. In fact this website is written using R-Markdown and RStudio. In order for RStudio to be able to interpret the document you have to use certain characters or combinations of characters when formatting text and including R-code to be evaluated. By default the document starts with the options for the text part. You can change the title, date, author and a few more advanced options. 

![First lines of an R-Markdown document](./rmdExplain/rmdHead.PNG)

The default is text mode, meaning that lines in an Rmd document will be interpreted as text, unless specified otherwise.

#### Headings

Usually you want to include some kind of heading to structure your text. A heading is created using `#` signs. A single `#` creates a first level heading, two `##` a second level and so on. 

![](./rmdExplain/headings.PNG)

It is important to note here that the ```#``` symbol means something different within the code chunks as opposed to outside of them. If you continue to put a ```#``` in front of all your regular text, it will all be interpreted as a first level heading, making your text very large.

#### Lists

Bullet point lists are created using `*`, `+` or `-`. Sub-items are created by indenting the item using 4 spaces or 2 tabs. 

````
* First Item
* Second Item
    + first sub-item
        - first sub-sub-item
    + second sub-item
````
* First Item
* Second Item
    + first sub-item
        - first sub-sub-item
    + second sub-item


Ordered lists can be created using numbers and letters. If you need sub-sub-items use `A)` instead of `A.` on the third level. 

````
1. First item
    a. first sub-item
        A) first sub-sub-item 
     b. second sub-item
2. Second item
````

1. First item
    a. first sub-item
        A) first sub-sub-item
    b. second sub-item
2. Second item


#### Text formatting

Text can be formatted in *italics* (`*italics*`) or **bold** (`**bold**`). In addition, you can ad block quotes with `>`

### R-Code

R-code is contained in so called "chunks". These chunks always start with three backticks and ```r``` in curly braces (``` ```{r} ```) and end with three backticks (``` ``` ```). Optionally, parameters can be added after the ```r``` to influence how a chunk behaves. Additionally, you can also give each chunk a name. Note that these have to be **unique**, otherwise R will refuse to knit your document.

#### Global and chunk options

The first chunk always looks as follows


    ```{r setup, include = FALSE}`r ''`
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    ```

It is added to the document automatically and sets options for all the following chunks. These options can be overwritten on a per-chunk basis. 

Keep `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)` to print your code to the document you will hand in. Changing it to `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)` will not print your code by default. This can be changed on a per-chunk basis.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

    ```{r cars, echo = FALSE}`r ''`
    summary(cars)

    plot(dist~speed, cars)
    ```


```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars)

plot(dist~speed, cars)
```

 
    ```{r cars2, echo = TRUE}`r ''`
    summary(cars)

    plot(dist~speed, cars)
    ```


```{r cars2, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)

plot(dist~speed, cars)
```

A good overview of all available global/chunk options can be found [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk_options).

### LaTeX Math

Writing well formatted mathematical formulae is done the same way as in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). Math mode is started and ended using `$$`. 
````
$$
 f_1(\omega) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \pi},\ \omega \in[-\pi, \pi]
$$
````

$$
 f_1(\omega) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \pi},\ \omega \in[-\pi, \pi]
$$

(for those interested this is the spectral density of [white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise))

Including inline mathematical notation is done with a single ```$``` symbol. 

````
${2\over3}$ of my code is inline.

````
${2\over3}$ of my code is inline.

Take a look at [this wikibook on Mathematics in LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Symbols) and [this list of Greek letters and mathematical symbols](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/List_of_Greek_letters_and_math_symbols) if you are not familiar with LaTeX.

In order to write multi-line equations in the same math environment, use `\\` after every line. In order to insert a space use a single `\`. To render text inside a math environment use `\text{here is the text}`. In order to align equations start with `\begin{align}` and place an `&` in each line at the point around which it should be aligned. Finally end with `\end{align}`

````
$$
\begin{align}
\text{First equation: }\ Y &= X \beta + \epsilon_y,\ \forall X \\
\text{Second equation: }\ X &= Z \gamma + \epsilon_x
\end{align}
$$
````

$$
\begin{align}
\text{First equation: }\ Y &= X \beta + \epsilon_y,\ \forall X \\
\text{Second equation: }\ X &= Z \gamma + \epsilon_x

$$

#### Important symbols

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, results="asis", warning = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

lat <- readLines("./lat.txt")

lat1 <- paste0("$", lat, "$")
lat2 <- paste0("```", lat, "```")

mathy.df <- data.frame(Symbol = lat1, Code = lat2) 

kable(mathy.df, escape=FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

The `{}` after `_` and `^` are not strictly necessary if there is only one character in the sub-/superscript. However, in order to place multiple characters in the sub-/superscript they are necessary. 
e.g.


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, results="asis", warning = FALSE}
lat <- readLines("./lat2.txt")

lat1 <- paste0("$", lat, "$")
lat2 <- paste0("```", lat, "```")

mathy.df <- data.frame(Symbol = lat1, Code = lat2) 

kable(mathy.df, escape=FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

#### Greek letters

[Greek letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Letters) are preceded by a `\` followed by their name (`$\beta$` = $\beta$). In order to capitalize them simply capitalize the first letter of the name (`$\Gamma$` = $\Gamma$).

# Introduction to Statistical Inference

This chapter will provide you with a basic intuition on statistical inference. As marketing researchers we are usually faced with "imperfect" data in the sense that we cannot collect **all** the data we would like. Imagine you are interested in the average amount of time WU students spend listening to music every month. Ideally, we could force all WU students to fill out our survey. Realistically we will only be able to observe a small fraction of students (maybe 500 out of the $25.000+$). With the data from this small fraction at hand, we want to make an inference about the true average listening time of all WU students. We are going to start with the assumption that we know everything. That is, we first assume that we know all WU students' listening times and analyze the distribution of the listening time in the entire population. Subsequently, we are going to look at the uncertainty that is introduced by only knowing some of the students' listening times (i.e., a sample from the population) and how that influences our analysis.

[You can download the corresponding R-Code here](./Code/06-statistical_inference (2).R)


## If we knew it all 

Assume there are $25,000$ students at WU and every single one has kindly provided us with the hours they listened to music in the past month. In this case, we know the true mean ($49.93$ hours) and the true standard deviation (SD = $10.02$) and thus we can easily summarize the entire distribution. Since the data follows a normal distribution, roughly 95% of the values lie within 2 standard deviations from the mean, as the following plot shows:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(latex2exp)
set.seed(321)
hours <- rnorm(25000, 50, 10)

ggplot(data.frame(hours)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(hours), bins = 50, fill = 'white', color = 'black') +
  labs(title = "Histogram of listening times",
       subtitle = TeX(sprintf("Population mean ($\\mu$) = %.2f; population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) = %.2f",round(mean(hours),2),round(sd(hours),2))),
       y = 'Number of students', 
       x = 'Hours') +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(hours), size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(hours)+2*sd(hours), colour = "red", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(hours)-2*sd(hours), colour = "red", size = 1) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = mean(hours), y = 1100, yend = 1100, xend = (mean(hours) - 2*sd(hours))), lineend = "butt", linejoin = "round",
     size = 0.5, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "inches"))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = mean(hours), y = 1100, yend = 1100, xend = (mean(hours) + 2*sd(hours))), lineend = "butt", linejoin = "round",
     size = 0.5, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "inches"))) +
  annotate("text", x = mean(hours) + 28, y = 1100, label = "Mean + 2 * SD" )+
  annotate("text", x = mean(hours) -28, y = 1100, label = "Mean - 2 * SD" )
```

In this case, we refere to all WU students as **the population**. In general, the population is the entire group we are interested in. This group does not have to necessarily consist of people, but could also be companies, stores, animals, etc.. The parameters of the distribution of population values (in hour case: "hours") are called population parameters. As already mentioned, we do not usually know population parameters but use inferential statistics to infer them based on our sample from the population, i.e., we measure statistics from a sample (e.g., the sample mean $\bar x$) to estimate population parameters (the population mean $\mu$). Here, we will use the following notation to refer to either the population parameters or the sample statistic: 

Variable	 | Sample statistic	 | Population parameter
------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------
Size  | n  | N 
Mean  |  $\bar{x} = {1 \over n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ | $\mu = {1 \over N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$  |
Variance  | $s^2 = {1 \over n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})^2$  | $\sigma^2 = {1 \over N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i-\mu)^2$  
Standard deviation | $s = \sqrt{s^2}$  | $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$  
Standard error | $SE_{\bar x} = {s \over \sqrt{n}}$  | $\sigma_{\bar x} = {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}$  

### Sampling from a known population

In the first step towards a realistic research setting, let us take one sample from this population and calculate the mean listening time. We can simply sample the row numbers of students and then subset the ```hours``` vector with the sampled rownumbers. The ```sample()``` function will be used to draw a sample of size 100 from the population of 25,000 students, and one student can only be drawn once (i.e., ```replace = FALSE```). The following plot shows the distribution of listening times for our sample.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
sample_1 <- hours[student_sample]
ggplot(data.frame(sample_1)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = sample_1), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Hours") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(sample_1)), size=1) +
  ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("Distribution of listening times ($\\bar{x}$ = %.2f)",round(mean(sample_1),2))))
```

Observe that in this first draw the mean ($\bar x =$ `r round(mean(sample_1),2)`) is quite close to the actual mean ($\mu = $ `r round(mean(hours),2)`). It seems like the sample mean is a decent estimate of the population mean. However, we could just be lucky this time and the next sample could turn out to have a different mean. Let us continue by looking at four additional random samples, consisting of 100 students each. The following plot shows the distribution of listening times for the four different samples from the population.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
#student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
#means <- hours[student_sample]
library(cowplot)
set.seed(8830)
student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
means1 <- hours[student_sample]
plot1 <- ggplot(data.frame(means1)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = means1), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Hours") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(means1)), size=1) +
 ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("$\\bar{x}_1$ = %.2f",round(mean(means1),2))))

set.seed(6789)
student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
means1 <- hours[student_sample]
plot2 <- ggplot(data.frame(means1)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = means1), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Hours") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(means1)), size=1) +
 ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("$\\bar{x}_2$ = %.2f",round(mean(means1),2))))

set.seed(3904)
student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
means1 <- hours[student_sample]
plot3 <- ggplot(data.frame(means1)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = means1), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Hours") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(means1)), size=1) +
 ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("$\\bar{x}_3$ = %.2f",round(mean(means1),2))))

set.seed(3333)
student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
means1 <- hours[student_sample]
plot4 <- ggplot(data.frame(means1)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = means1), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Hours") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(means1)), size=1) +
 ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("$\\bar{x}_4$ = %.2f",round(mean(means1),2))))

p <- plot_grid(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, ncol = 2,
           labels = c("A", "B","C","D"))
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label('Distribution of listening times in four different samples', fontface='bold')
p <- plot_grid(title, p, ncol=1, rel_heights=c(0.1, 1)) # rel_heights values control title margins
print(p)

```

It becomes clear that the mean is slightly different for each sample. This is referred to as **sampling variation** and it is completely fine to get a slightly different mean every time we take a sample. We just need to find a way of expressing the uncertainty associated with the fact that we only have data from one sample, because in a realistic setting you are most likely only going to have access to a single sample. 

So in order to make sure that the first draw is not just pure luck and the sample mean is in fact a good estimate for the population mean, let us take **many** (e.g., $20,000$) different samples from the population. That is, we repeatedly draw 100 students randomly from the population without replacement (that is, once a student has been drawn she or he is removed from the pool and cannot be drawn again) and calculate the mean of each sample. This will show us a range within which the sample mean of any sample we take is likely going to be. We are going to store the means of all the samples in a matrix and then plot a histogram of the means to observe the likely values. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
set.seed(12345)
samples <- 20000
means <- matrix(NA, nrow = samples)
for (i in 1:samples){
  student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
  means[i,] <- mean(hours[student_sample])
}

meansdf <- data.frame('true' = mean(hours), 'sample' = mean(means))
meansdf <- gather(meansdf)
ggplot(data.frame(means)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = means), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(data = meansdf, aes(xintercept = value, color = key, linetype = key), size=1) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("Mean of sample means", "Population mean")) +
  scale_linetype_discrete(labels = c("Mean of sample means", "Population mean")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of listening times",
       subtitle = TeX(sprintf("Population mean ($\\mu$) = %.2f; population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) = %.2f",round(mean(hours),2),round(sd(hours),2))),
       y = 'Number of students', 
       x = 'Hours') 
```

As you can see, on average the sample mean ("mean of sample means") is extremely close to the population mean, despite only sampling $100$ people at a time. This distribution of sample means is also referred to as **sampling distribution** of the sample mean. However, there is some uncertainty, and the means are slightly different for the different samples and range from `r round(min(means),2)` to `r round(max(means),2)`. 

### Standard error of the mean

Due to the variation in the sample means shown in our simulation, it is never possible to say exactly what the population mean is based on a single sample. However, even with a single sample we can infer a range of values within which the population mean is likely contained. In order to do so, notice that the sample means are approximately normally distributed. Another interesting fact is that the mean of sample means (i.e., `r round(mean(means),2)`) is roughly equal to the population mean (i.e., `r round(mean(hours),2)`). This tells us already that generally the sample mean is a good approximation of the population mean. However, in order to make statements about the expected range of possible values, we would need to know the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The formal representation of the standard deviation of the sample means is

$$
\sigma_{\bar x} = {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}
$$

where $\sigma$ is the population SD and $n$ is the sample size. $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ is referred to as the **Standard Error** of the mean and it expresses the variation in sample means we should expect given the number of observations in our sample and the population SD. That is, it provides a measure of how precisely we can estimate the population mean from the sample mean.   

#### Sample size

The first thing to notice here is that an increase in the **number of observations per sample** $n$ decreases the range of possible sample means (i.e., the standard error). This makes intuitive sense. Think of the two extremes: sample size $1$ and sample size $25,000$. With a single person in the sample we do not gain a lot of information and our estimate is very uncertain, which is expressed through a larger standard deviation. Looking at the histogram at the beginning of this chapter showing the number of students for each of the listening times, clearly we would get values below $25$ or above $75$ for some samples. This is way farther away from the population mean than the minimum and the maximum of our $100$ person samples. On the other hand, if we sample every student we get the population mean every time and thus we do not have any uncertainty (assuming the population does not change). Even if we only sample, say $24,000$ people every time, we gain a lot of information about the population and the sample means would not be very different from each other since only up to $1,000$ people are potentially different in any given sample. Thus, with larger (smaller) samples, there is less (more) uncertainty that the sample is a good approximation of the entire population. The following plot shows the relationship between the sample size and the standard error. Samples of increasing size are randomly drawn from the population of WU students. You can see that the standard error is decreasing with the number of observations. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Relationship between the sample size and the standard error"}
set.seed(321)
hours <- rnorm(25000, 50, 10)

R <- 1000
sems <- numeric()
replication <- numeric()

for (r in 10:R) {
  y_sample <- sample(hours, r)
  sem <- sd(hours)/sqrt(length(y_sample))
  sems <- rbind(sems, sem)
  replication <- rbind(replication, r)
}

df <- as.data.frame(cbind(replication, sems))
ggplot(data=df, aes(y = sems, x = replication)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Standard error of the mean") + 
  xlab("Sample size") + 
  ggtitle('Relationship between sample size and standard error') +
  theme_bw()
```

The following plots show the relationship between the sample size and the standard error in a slightly different way. The plots show the range of sample means resulting from the repeated sampling process for different sample sizes. Notice that the more students are contained in the individual samples, the less uncertainty there is when estimating the population mean from a sample (i.e., the possible values are more closely centered around the mean). So when the sample size is small, the sample mean can expected to be very different the next time we take a sample. When the sample size is large, we can expect the sample means to be more similar every time we take a sample.

```

As you can see, the standard deviation of the sample means ($\sigma_{\bar x}$) decreases as the sample size increases as a consequence of the reduced uncertainty about the true sample mean when we take larger samples. 

#### Population standard deviation

A second factor determining the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means ($\sigma_{\bar x}$) is the standard deviation associated with the population parameter ($\sigma$). Again, looking at the extremes illustrates this well. If all WU students listened to music for approximately the same amount of time, the samples would not differ much from each other. In other words, if the standard deviation in the population is lower, we expect the standard deviation of the sample means to be lower as well. This is illustrated by the following plots.

```

In the first plot (panel A), we assume a much smaller population standard deviation (e.g., $\sigma$ = 1 instead of $\sigma$ = 10). Notice how the smaller (larger) the population standard deviation, the less (more) uncertainty there is when estimating the population mean from a sample (i.e., the possible values are more closely centered around the mean). So when the population SD is large, the sample mean can expected to be very different the next time we take a sample. When the population SD is small, we can expect the sample means to be more similar.

## The Central Limit Theorem

The attentive reader might have noticed that the population above was generated using a normal distribution function. It would be very restrictive if we could only analyze populations whose values are normally distributed. Furthermore, we are unable in reality to check whether the population values are normally distributed since we do not know the entire population. However, it turns out that the results generalize to many other distributions. This is described by the **Central Limit Theorem**. 

The central limit theorem states that if **(1)** the population distribution has a mean (there are examples of distributions that don't have a mean , but we will ignore these here), and **(2)** we take a large enough sample, then the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normally distributed. What exactly "large enough" means depends on the setting, but the interactive element at the end of this chapter illustrates how the sample size influences how accurately we can estimate the population parameters from the sample statistics.

To illustrate this, let's repeat the analysis above with a population from a gamma distribution. In the previous example, we assumed a normal distribution so it was more likely for a given student to spend around 50 hours per week listening to music. The following example depicts the case in which most students spend a similar amount of time listening to music, but there are a few students who very rarely listen to music, and some music enthusiasts with a very high level of listening time. Here is a histogram of the listening times in the population:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
set.seed(321)
hours <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2, scale = 10)
ggplot(data.frame(hours)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = hours), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(hours), size = 1)  +  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of listening times",
       subtitle = TeX(sprintf("Population mean ($\\mu$) = %.2f; population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) = %.2f",round(mean(hours),2),round(sd(hours),2))),
       y = 'Number of students', 
       x = 'Hours') 

```

The vertical black line represents the population mean ($\mu$), which is `r round(mean(hours),2)` hours. The following plot depicts the histogram of listening times of four random samples from the population, each consisting of 100 students: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
#student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)

  geom_histogram(aes(x = means1), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +

  theme_bw() + xlab("Hours") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(means1)), size=1) +
 ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("$\\bar{x}$ = %.2f",round(mean(means1),2))))

p <- plot_grid(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4, ncol = 2,
           labels = c("A", "B","C","D"))
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label('Distribution of listening times in four different samples', fontface='bold')
p <- plot_grid(title, p, ncol=1, rel_heights=c(0.1, 1)) # rel_heights values control title margins
print(p)

```

As in the previous example, the mean is slightly different every time we take a sample due to sampling variation. Also note that the distribution of listening times no longer follows a normal distribution as a result of the fact that we now assume a gamma distribution for the population with a positive skew (i.e., lower values more likely, higher values less likely). 

Let's see what happens to the distribution of sample means if we take an increasing number of samples, each drawn from the same gamma population:

p <- plot_grid(title, p, ncol=1, rel_heights=c(0.1, 1)) # rel_heights values control title margins
print(p)

```

Two things are worth noting: **(1)** The more (hypothetical) samples we take, the more the sampling distribution approaches a normal distribution. **(2)** The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean ($\mu_{\bar x}$) is very similar to the population mean ($\mu$). From this we can see that the mean of a sample is a good estimate of the population mean. 

In summary, it is important to distinguish two types of variation: **(1)** For each individual sample that we may take in real life, the standard deviation ($s$) is used to describe the **natural variation** in the data and the data may follow a non-normal distribution. **(2)** If we would (hypothetically!) repeat the study many times, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows a normal distribution for large samples sizes (even if data from each individual study are non-normal), and the standard error ($\sigma_{\bar x}$) is used to describe the **variation between study results**. This is an important feature, since many statistical tests assume that the sampling distribution is normally distributed. As we have seen, this does **not** mean that the data from one particular sample needs to follow a normal distribution.

## Using what we actually know

So far we have assumed to know the population standard deviation ($\sigma$). This an unrealistic assumption since we do not know the entire population. The best guess for the population standard deviation we have is the sample standard deviation, denoted $s$. Thus, the standard error of the mean is usually estimated from the sample standard deviation: 

$$
\sigma_{\bar x} \approx SE_{\bar x}={s \over \sqrt{n}}
$$

Note that $s$ itself is a sample estimate of the population parameter $\sigma$. This additional estimation introduces further uncertainty. You can see in the interactive element below that the sample SD, on average, provides a good estimate of the population SD. That is, the distribution of sample SDs that we get by drawing many samples is centered around the population value. Again, the larger the sample, the closer any given sample SD is going to be to the population parameter and we introduce less uncertainty. One conclusion is that your sample needs to be large enough to provide a reliable estimate of the population parameters. What exactly "large enough" means depends on the setting, but the interactive element illustrates how the remaining values change as a function of the sample size.

We will not go into detail about the importance of random samples but basically the correctness of your estimate depends crucially on having a sample at hand that actually represents the population. Unfortunately, we will usually not notice if the sample is non-random. Our statistics are still a good approximation of "a" population parameter, namely the one for the population that we actually sampled but not the one we are interested in. To illustrate this uncheck the "Random Sample" box below. The new sample will be only from the top $50\%$ music listeners (but this generalizes to different types of non-random samples).

### Confidence Intervals for the Sample Mean

When we try to estimate parameters of populations (e.g., the population mean $\mu$) from a sample, the average value from a sample (e.g., the sample mean $\bar x$) only provides an estimate of what the real population parameter is. The next time you collect a sample of the same size, you could get a different average. This is sampling variation and it is completely fine to get a slightly different sample mean every time we take a sample as we have seen above. However, this inherent uncertainty about the true population parameter means that coming up with an exact estimate (i.e., a **point estimate**) for a particular population parameter is really difficult. That is why it is often informative to construct a range around that statistic (i.e., an **interval estimate**) that likely contains the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. That is, we construct an interval such that for a large share (say 95%) of the sample means we could potentially get, the population mean is within that interval.

Let us consider one random sample of 100 students from our population above. 

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width=6}
set.seed(321)
hours <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2, scale = 10)

set.seed(6789)
sample_size <- 100
student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = sample_size, replace = FALSE)
hours_s <- hours[student_sample]

plot2 <- ggplot(data.frame(hours_s)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = hours_s), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Hours") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(hours_s)), size=1) +
 ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("Random sample; $n$ = %d; $\\bar{x}$ = %.2f; $s$ = %.2f",sample_size,round(mean(hours_s),2),round(sd(hours_s),2))))
plot2
```

From the central limit theorem we know that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal and we know that for the normal distribution, 95% of the values lie within about 2 standard deviations from the mean. Actually, it is not exactly 2 standard deviations from the mean. To get the exact number, we can use the quantile function for the normal distribution ```qnorm()```:  

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width=6}
qnorm(0.975)
```

We use ```0.975``` (and not ```0.95```) to account for the probability at each end of the distribution (i.e., 2.5% at the lower end and 2.5% at the upper end). We can see that 95% of the values are roughly within `r round(qnorm(0.975),2)` standard deviations from the mean. Since we know the sample mean ($\bar x$) and we can estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution ($\sigma_{\bar x} \approx {s \over \sqrt{n}}$), we can now easily calculate the lower and upper boundaries of our confidence interval as:

$$
CI_{lower} = {\bar x} - z_{1-{\alpha \over 2}} * \sigma_{\bar x} \\
CI_{upper} = {\bar x} + z_{1-{\alpha \over 2}} * \sigma_{\bar x}
$$ 

Here, $\alpha$ refers to the significance level. You can find a detailed discussion of this point at the end of the next chapter. For now, we will adopt the widely accepted significance level of 5% and set $\alpha$ to 0.05. Thus, $\pm z_{1-{\alpha \over 2}}$ gives us the z-scores (i.e., number of standard deviations from the mean) within which range 95% of the probability density lies. 

Plugging in the values from our sample, we get:

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width=6}
sample_mean <- mean(hours_s)
se <- sd(hours_s)/sqrt(sample_size)
ci_lower <- sample_mean - qnorm(0.975)*se
ci_upper <- sample_mean + qnorm(0.975)*se
ci_lower
ci_upper
```

such that if we collected 100 samples and computed the mean and confidence interval for each of them, in $95\%$ of the cases, the true population mean is going to be within this interval between `r round(ci_lower,2)` and `r round(ci_upper,2)`. This is illustrated in the plot below that shows the mean of the first 100 samples and their confidence intervals:

```{r, fig.height = 15, fig.width=10}
set.seed(12)
samples <- 100
hours <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2, scale = 10)
means <- matrix(NA, nrow = samples)
for (i in 1:samples){
  student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
  means[i,] <- mean(hours[student_sample])
}

means_sd <- data.frame(means, lower =  means - qnorm(0.975) * (sd(hours)/sqrt(100)), upper = means + qnorm(0.975) * (sd(hours)/sqrt(100)), y = 1:100)
means_sd$diff <- factor(ifelse(means_sd$lower > mean(hours) | means_sd$upper < mean(hours), 'No', 'Yes'))

ggplot2::ggplot(means_sd, aes(y = y)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 100, by = 1), expand = c(0.005,0.005)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = means, color = diff)) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper, color = diff)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(hours)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "black")) +
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="True mean in CI")) +
  theme_bw()

```

Note that this does **not** mean that for a specific sample there is a $95\%$ chance that the population mean lies within its confidence interval. The statement depends on the large number of samples we do not actually draw in a real setting. You can view the set of all possible confidence intervals similarly to the sides of a coin or a die. If we throw a coin many times, we are going to observe head roughly half of the times. This does not, however, exclude the possibility of observing tails for the first 10 throws. Similarly, any specific confidence interval might or might not include the population mean but if we take many samples on average $95\%$ of the confidence intervals are going to include the population mean.

## Summary

When conducting research, we are (almost) always faced with the problem of not having access to the entire group we are interested in. Therefore, we use sample properties that we have derived in this chapter to do statistical inference based on a single sample. We use statistics of the sample as well as the sample size to calculate the confidence interval of our choice (e.g. $95\%$). In practice most of this is done for us, so you won't need to do this by hand. With a sample at hand, we need to choose the appropriate test and a null hypothesis. How this is done will be discussed in the next chapter.

# Hypothesis testing

This chapter is primarily based on Field, A., Miles J., & Field, Z. (2012): Discovering Statistics Using R. Sage Publications, **chapter 5**.

[You can download the corresponding R-Code here](./Code/07-hypothesis_testing (2).R)

## Introduction

We test hypotheses because we are confined to taking samples – we rarely work with the entire population. In the previous chapter, we introduced the standard error (i.e., the standard deviation of a large number of hypothetical samples) as an estimate of how well a particular sample represents the population. We also saw how we can construct confidence intervals around the sample mean $\bar x$ by computing $SE_{\bar x}$ as an estimate of $\sigma_{\bar x}$ using $s$ as an estimate of $\sigma$ and calculating the 95% CI as $\bar x \pm 1.96 * SE_{\bar x}$. Although we do not know the true population mean ($\mu$), we might have an hypothesis about it and this would tell us how the corresponding sampling distribution looks like. Based on the sampling distribution of the hypothesized population mean, we could then determine the probability of a given sample **assuming that the hypothesis is true**. 

Let us again begin by assuming we know the entire population using the example of music listening times among students from the previous example. As a reminder, the following plot shows the distribution of music listening times in the population of WU students. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(latex2exp)
set.seed(321)
hours <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2, scale = 10)
ggplot(data.frame(hours)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = hours), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(hours), size = 1)  +  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of listening times",
       subtitle = TeX(sprintf("Population mean ($\\mu$) = %.2f; population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) = %.2f",round(mean(hours),2),round(sd(hours),2))),
       y = 'Number of students', 
       x = 'Hours') 
```

In this example, the population mean ($\mu$) is equal to `r round(mean(hours),2)`, and the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is equal to `r round(sd(hours),2)`. 

### The null hypothesis

Let us assume that we were planning to take a random sample of 50 students from this population and our hypothesis was that the mean listening time is equal to some specific value $\mu_0$, say $10$. This would be our **null hypothesis**. The null hypothesis refers to the statement that is being tested and is usually a statement of the status quo, one of no difference or no effect. In our example, the null hypothesis would state that there is no difference between the true population mean $\mu$ and the hypothesized value $\mu_0$ (in our example $10$), which can be expressed as follows:

$$
H_0: \mu = \mu_0
$$
When conducting research, we are usually interested in providing evidence against the null hypothesis. If we then observe sufficient evidence against it, our estimate is said to be significant. If the null hypothesis is rejected, this is taken as support for the **alternative hypothesis**. The alternative hypothesis assumes that some difference exists, which can be expressed as follows: 

$$
H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0
$$
Accepting the alternative hypothesis in turn will often lead to changes in opinions or actions. Note that while the null hypothesis may be rejected, it can never be accepted based on a single test. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, it means that we simply haven't collected enough evidence against the null hypothesis to disprove it. In classical hypothesis testing, there is no way to determine whether the null hypothesis is true. **Hypothesis testing** provides a means to quantify to what extent the data from our sample is in line with the null hypothesis.

In order to quantify the concept of "sufficient evidence" we look at the theoretical distribution of the sample means given our null hypothesis and the sample standard error. Using the available information we can infer the sampling distribution for our null hypothesis. Recall that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (i.e., the standard error of the mean) is given by $\sigma_{\bar x}={\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}$, and thus can be computed as follows:

```{r}
mean_pop <- mean(hours)
sigma <- sd(hours) #population standard deviation
n <- 50 #sample size
standard_error <- sigma/sqrt(n) #standard error
standard_error
```

Since we know from the central limit theorem that the sampling distribution is normal for large enough samples, we can now visualize the expected sampling distribution **if our null hypothesis was in fact true** (i.e., if the was no difference between the true population mean and the hypothesized mean of 10). 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
library(latex2exp)
H_0 <- 10
p1 <- 0.025
p2 <- 0.975
min <- 0
max <- 20
norm1 <- round(qnorm(p1), digits = 3)
norm2 <- round(qnorm(p2), digits = 3)
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(min, max)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = H_0, sd = standard_error)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = H_0, sd = standard_error), xlim = c(min, qnorm(p1, mean = H_0, sd = standard_error)), geom = "area") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = H_0, sd = standard_error), xlim = c(max, qnorm(p2, mean = H_0, sd = standard_error)), geom = "area") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0,qnorm(p1, mean = H_0, sd = standard_error),10,qnorm(p2, mean = H_0, sd = standard_error),20), labels=c("0",TeX(sprintf("%.2f $* \\sigma_{\\bar x}$",qnorm(p1))),"10",TeX(sprintf("%.2f $* \\sigma_{\\bar x}$",qnorm(p2))),"20")) +
  labs(title = TeX(sprintf("Theoretical density given null hypothesis $\\mu_0=$ 10 ($\\sigma_{\\bar x}$ = %.2f)",standard_error)),x = "Hours", y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  theme_bw()
```

We also know that 95% of the probability is within `r round(qnorm(p2),2)` standard deviations from the mean. Values higher than that are rather unlikely, if our hypothesis about the population mean was indeed true. This is shown by the shaded area, also known as the "rejection region". To test our hypothesis that the population mean is equal to $10$, let us take a random sample from the population.

```{r}
set.seed(12567)
H_0 <- 10
student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 50, replace = FALSE)
student_sample <- hours[student_sample]
mean_sample <- mean(student_sample)
ggplot(data.frame(student_sample)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = student_sample), fill = 'white', color = 'black', bins = 20) +
  theme_bw() +  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(student_sample), color = 'black', size=1) +
  labs(title = TeX(sprintf("Distribution of values in the sample ($n =$ %.0f, $\\bar{x] = $ %.2f, s = %.2f)",n,mean(student_sample),sd(student_sample))),x = "Hours", y = "Frequency") 
```

The mean listening time in the sample (black line) $\bar x$ is `r round(mean(student_sample),2)`. We can already see from the graphic above that such a value is rather unlikely under the hypothesis that the population mean is $10$. Intuitively, such a result would therefore provide evidence against our null hypothesis. But how could we quantify specifically how unlikely it is to obtain such a value and decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis? Significance tests can be used to provide answers to these questions. 



### Statistical inference on a sample

#### Test statistic

##### z-scores

Let's go back to the sampling distribution above. We know that 95% of all values will fall within `r round(qnorm(p2),2)` standard deviations from the mean. So if we could express the distance between our sample mean and the null hypothesis in terms of standard deviations, we could make statements about the probability of getting a sample mean of the observed magnitude (or more extreme values). Essentially, we would like to know how many standard deviations ($\sigma_{\bar x}$) our sample mean ($\bar x$) is away from the population mean if the null hypothesis was true ($\mu_0$). This can be formally expressed as follows:

$$
\bar x-  \mu_0 = z \sigma_{\bar x}
$$

In this equation, ```z``` will tell us how many standard deviations the sample mean $\bar x$ is away from the null hypothesis $\mu_0$. Solving for ```z``` gives us:

$$
z = {\bar x-  \mu_0 \over \sigma_{\bar x}}={\bar x-  \mu_0 \over \sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

This standardized value (or "z-score") is also referred to as a **test statistic**. Let's compute the test statistic for our example above:

```{r}
z_score <- (mean_sample - H_0)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
z_score
```

To make a decision on whether the difference can be deemed statistically significant, we now need to compare this calculated test statistic to a meaningful threshold. In order to do so, we need to decide on a significance level $\alpha$, which expresses the probability of finding an effect that does not actually exist (i.e., Type I Error). You can find a detailed discussion of this point at the end of this chapter. For now, we will adopt the widely accepted significance level of 5% and set $\alpha$ to 0.05. The critical value for the normal distribution and $\alpha$ = 0.05 can be computed using the ```qnorm()``` function as follows:

```{r}
z_crit <- qnorm(0.975)
z_crit
```

We use ```0.975``` and not ```0.95``` since we are running a two-sided test and need to account for the rejection region at the other end of the distribution. Recall that for the normal distribution, 95% of the total probability falls within `r round(qnorm(0.975),2)` standard deviations of the mean, so that higher (absolute) values provide evidence against the null hypothesis. Generally, we speak of a statistically significant effect if the (absolute) calculated test statistic is larger than the (absolute) critical value. We can easily check if this is the case in our example:

```{r}
abs(z_score) > abs(z_crit)
```

Since the absolute value of the calculated test statistic is larger than the critical value, we would reject $H_0$ and conclude that the true population mean $\mu$ is significantly different from the hypothesized value $\mu_0 = 10$.

##### t-statistic

You may have noticed that the formula for the z-score above assumes that we know the true population standard deviation ($\sigma$) when computing the standard deviation of the sampling distribution ($\sigma_{\bar x}$) in the denominator. However, the population standard deviation is usually not known in the real world and therefore represents another unknown population parameter which we have to estimate from the sample. We saw in the previous chapter that we usually use $s$ as an estimate of $\sigma$ and $SE_{\bar x}$ as and estimate of $\sigma_{\bar x}$. Intuitively, we should be more conservative regarding the critical value that we used above to assess whether we have a significant effect to reflect this uncertainty about the true population standard deviation. That is, the threshold for a "significant" effect should be higher to safeguard against falsely claiming a significant effect when there is none. If we replace $\sigma_{\bar x}$ by it's estimate $SE_{\bar x}$ in the formula for the z-score, we get a new test statistic (i.e, the **t-statistic**) with its own distribution (the **t-distribution**): 

$$
t = {\bar x-  \mu_0 \over SE_{\bar x}}={\bar x-  \mu_0 \over s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

Here, $\bar X$ denotes the sample mean and $s$ the sample standard deviation. The t-distribution has more probability in its "tails", i.e. farther away from the mean. This reflects the higher uncertainty introduced by replacing the population standard deviation by its sample estimate. Intuitively, this is particularly relevant for small samples, since the uncertainty about the true population parameters decreases with increasing sample size. This is reflected by the fact that the exact shape of the t-distribution depends on the **degrees of freedom**, which is the sample size minus one (i.e., $n-1$). To see this, the following graph shows the t-distribution with different degrees of freedom for a two-tailed test and $\alpha = 0.05$. The grey curve shows the normal distribution.

```

Notice that as $n$ gets larger, the t-distribution gets closer and closer to the normal distribution, reflecting the fact that the uncertainty introduced by $s$ is reduced. To summarize, we now have an estimate for the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample mean (i.e., $SE_{\bar x}$) and an appropriate distribution that takes into account the necessary uncertainty (i.e., the t-distribution). Let us now compute the t-statistic according to the formula above:

```{r}
SE <- (sd(student_sample)/sqrt(n))
t_score <- (mean_sample - H_0)/SE
t_score
```

Notice that the value of the t-statistic is higher compared to the z-score (`r round(z_score,2)`). This can be attributed to the fact that by using the $s$ as and estimate of $\sigma$, we underestimate the true population standard deviation. Hence, the critical value would need to be larger to adjust for this. This is what the t-distribution does. Let us compute the critical value from the t-distribution with ```n - 1```degrees of freedom.     

```{r}
df = n - 1
t_crit <- qt(0.975, df = df)
t_crit
```

Again, we use ```0.975``` and not ```0.95``` since we are running a two-sided test and need to account for the rejection region at the other end of the distribution. Notice that the new critical value based on the t-distributionis larger, to reflect the uncertainty when estimating $\sigma$ from $s$. Now we can see that the calculated test statistic is still larger than the critical value.  

```{r}
abs(t_score) > abs(t_crit)
```

The following graphics shows that the calculated test statistic (red line) falls into the rejection region so that in our example, we would reject the null hypothesis that the true population mean is equal to $10$. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
p1 <- 0.025
p2 <- 0.975
min <- -6
max <- 6
t1 <- round(qt(p1, df = df), digits = 3)
t2 <- round(qt(p2, df = df), digits = 3)
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(min, max)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = df)) + 
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = df), xlim = c(min, qt(p1, df = df)), geom = "area") +
  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = df), xlim = c(max, qt(p2, df = df)), geom = "area") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = t_score, color = 'red', size=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(t1, 0, t2)) +
    labs(title = "Theoretical density given null hypothesis 10 and sample t-statistic",
         x = "x", y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  theme_bw()
```

**Decision:** Reject $H_0$, given that the calculated test statistic is larger than critical value.

Something to keep in mind here is the fact the test statistic is a function of the sample size. This, as $n$ gets large, the test statistic gets larger as well and we are more likely to find a significant effect. This reflects the decrease in uncertainty about the true population mean as our sample size increases.  

#### P-values

In the previous section, we computed the test statistic, which tells us how close our sample is to the null hypothesis. The p-value corresponds to the probability that the test statistic would take a value as extreme or more extreme than the one that we actually observed, **assuming that the null hypothesis is true**. It is important to note that this is a **conditional probability**: we compute the probability of observing a sample mean (or a more extreme value) conditional on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. The ```pnorm()```function can be used to compute this probability. It is the cumulative probability distribution function of the `normal distribution. Cumulative probability means that the function returns the probability that the test statistic will take a value **less than or equal to** the calculated test statistic given the degrees of freedom. However, we are interested in obtaining the probability of observing a test statistic **larger than or equal to** the calculated test statistic under the null hypothesis (i.e., the p-value). Thus, we need to subtract the cumulative probability from 1. In addition, since we are running a two-sided test, we need to multiply the probability by 2 to account for the rejection region at the other side of the distribution.  

```{r}
p_value <- 2*(1-pt(abs(t_score), df = df))
p_value
```

This value corresponds to the probability of observing a mean equal to or larger than the one we obtained from our sample, if the null hypothesis was true. As you can see, this probability is very low. A small p-value signals that it is unlikely to observe the calculated test statistic under the null hypothesis. To decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis, we would now compare this value to the level of significance ($\alpha$) that we chose for our test. For this example, we adopt the widely accepted significance level of 5%, so any test results with a p-value < 0.05 would be deemed statistically significant. Note that the p-value is directly related to the value of the test statistic. The relationship is such that the higher (lower) the value of the test statistic, the lower (higher) the p-value.   

**Decision:** Reject $H_0$, given that the p-value is smaller than 0.05. 

#### Confidence interval

For a given statistic calculated for a sample of observations (e.g., listening times), a 95% confidence interval can be constructed such that in 95% of samples, the true value of the true population mean will fall within its limits. If the parameter value specified in the null hypothesis (here $10$) does not lie within the bounds, we reject $H_0$. Building on what we learned about confidence intervals in the previous chapter, the 95% confidence interval based on the t-distribution can be computed as follows:

$$
CI_{lower} = {\bar x} - t_{1-{\alpha \over 2}} * SE_{\bar x} \\
CI_{upper} = {\bar x} + t_{1-{\alpha \over 2}} * SE_{\bar x}
$$ 

It is easy to compute this interval manually:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ci_lower <- (mean_sample)-qt(0.975, df = df)*SE
ci_upper <- (mean_sample)+qt(0.975, df = df)*SE
ci_lower
ci_upper
```

The interpretation of this interval is as follows: if we would (hypothetically) take 100 samples and calculated the mean and confidence interval for each of them, then the true population mean would be included in 95% of these intervals. The CI is informative when reporting the result of your test, since it provides an estimate of the uncertainty associated with the test result. From the test statistic or the p-value alone, it is not easy to judge in which range the true population parameter is located.  The CI provides an estimate of this range. 

**Decision:** Reject $H_0$, given that the parameter value from the null hypothesis ($10$) is not included in the interval. 

To summarize, you can see that we arrive at the same conclusion (i.e., reject $H_0$), irrespective if we use the test statistic, the p-value, or the confidence interval. However, keep in mind that rejecting the null hypothesis does not prove the alternative hypothesis (we can merely provide support for it). Rather, think of the p-value as the chance of obtaining the data we've collected assuming that the null hypothesis is true. You should report the confidence interval to provide an estimate of the uncertainty associated with your test results.  

### Choosing the right test

The test statistic, as we have seen, measures how close the sample is to the null hypothesis and often follows a well-known distribution (e.g., normal, t, or chi-square). To select the correct test, various factors need to be taken into consideration. Some examples are:

* On what scale are your variables measured (categorical vs. continuous)?
* Do you want to test for relationships or differences?
* If you test for differences, how many groups would you like to test?
* For parametric tests, are the assumptions fulfilled?

The previous discussion used a **one sample t-test** as an example, which requires that variable is measured on an interval or ratio scale. If you are confronted with other settings, the following flow chart provides a rough guideline on selecting the correct test:

![Flowchart for selecting an appropriate test (source: McElreath, R. (2016): Statistical Rethinking, p. 2)](https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/testselection.JPG)

For a detailed overview over the different type of tests, please also refer to <a href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/" target="_blank">this overview</a> by the UCLA.

#### Parametric vs. non-parametric tests

A basic distinction can be made between parametric and non-parametric tests. **Parametric tests** require that variables are measured on an interval or ratio scale and that the sampling distribution follows a known distribution. **Non-Parametric tests** on the other hand do not require the sampling distribution to be normally distributed (a.k.a. "assumption free tests"). These tests may be used when the variable of interest is measured on an ordinal scale or when the parametric assumptions do not hold. They often rely on ranking the data instead of analyzing the actual scores. By ranking the data, information on the magnitude of differences is lost. Thus, parametric tests are more powerful if the sampling distribution is normally distributed. In this chapter, we will first focus on parametric tests and cover non-parametric tests later. 

#### One-tailed vs. two-tailed test

For some tests you may choose between a **one-tailed test** versus a **two-tailed test**. The choice depends on the hypothesis you specified, i.e., whether you specified a directional or a non-directional hypotheses. In the example above, we used a **non-directional hypothesis**. That is, we stated that the mean is different from the comparison value $\mu_0$, but we did not state the direction of the effect. A **directional hypothesis** states the direction of the effect. For example, we might test whether the population mean is smaller than a comparison value:

$$
H_0: \mu \ge \mu_0 \\
H_1: \mu < \mu_0
$$

Similarly, we could test whether the population mean is larger than a comparison value:

$$
H_0: \mu \le \mu_0 \\
H_1: \mu > \mu_0
$$

Connected to the decision of how to phrase the hypotheses (directional vs. non-directional) is the choice of a **one-tailed test** versus a **two-tailed test**. Let's first think about the meaning of a one-tailed test. Using a significance level of 0.05, a one-tailed test means that 5% of the total area under the probability distribution of our test statistic is located in one tail. Thus, under a one-tailed test, we test for the possibility of the relationship in one direction only, disregarding the possibility of a relationship in the other direction. In our example, a one-tailed test could test either if the mean listening time is significantly larger or smaller compared to the control condition, but not both. Depending on the direction, the mean listening time is significantly larger (smaller) if the test statistic is located in the top (bottom) 5% of its probability distribution. 

The following graph shows the critical values that our test statistic would need to surpass so that the difference between the population mean and the comparison value would be deemed statistically significant.

```

It can be seen that under a one-sided test, the rejection region is at one end of the distribution or the other. In a two-sided test, the rejection region is split between the two tails. As a consequence, the critical value of the test statistic is smaller using a one-tailed test, meaning that it has more power to detect an effect. Having said that, in most applications, we would like to be able catch effects in both directions, simply because we can often not rule out that an effect might exist that is not in the hypothesized direction. For example, if we would conduct a one-tailed test for a mean larger than some specified value but the mean turns out to be substantially smaller, then testing a one-directional hypothesis ($H_0: \mu \le \mu_0 $) would not allow us to conclude that there is a significant effect because there is not rejection at this end of the distribution.   

### Summary

As we have seen, the process of hypothesis testing consists of various steps:

1. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
2. Select an appropriate test
3. Choose the level of significance ($\alpha$)
4. Descriptive statistics and data visualization
5. Conduct significance test
6. Report results and draw a marketing conclusion

# Chi-square test
This chapter is primarily based on Field, A., Miles J., & Field, Z. (2012): Discovering Statistics Using R. Sage Publications, **chapter 18**.

In some instances, you will be confronted with differences between proportions, rather than differences between means. For example, you may conduct an A/B-Test and wish to compare the conversion rates between two advertising campaigns. In this case, your data is binary (0 = no conversion, 1 = conversion) and the sampling distribution for such data is binomial. While binomial probabilities are difficult to calculate, we can use a Normal approximation to the binomial when ```n``` is large (>100) and the true likelihood of a 1 is not too close to 0 or 1. 

Let's use an example: assume a call center where service agents call potential customers to sell a product. We consider two call center agents:

* Service agent 1 talks to 300 customers and gets 200 of them to buy (conversion rate=2/3)
* Service agent 2 talks to 300 customers and gets 100 of them to buy (conversion rate=1/3)

As always, we load the data first:

[You can download the corresponding R-Code here](./Code/10-categorical_data (1).R)


```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
call_center <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/master/MRDA2017/call_center.dat", 
                          sep = "\t", 
                          header = TRUE) #read in data
call_center$conversion <- factor(call_center$conversion , levels = c(0:1), labels = c("no", "yes")) #convert to factor
call_center$agent <- factor(call_center$agent , levels = c(0:1), labels = c("agent_1", "agent_2")) #convert to factor
```

Next, we create a table to check the relative frequencies:

```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
rel_freq_table <- as.data.frame(prop.table(table(call_center), 2)) #conditional relative frequencies
rel_freq_table
```

We could also plot the data to visualize the frequencies using ggplot:

```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "proportion of conversions per agent (stacked bar chart)"}
ggplot(rel_freq_table, aes(x = agent, y = Freq, fill = conversion)) + #plot data
  geom_col(width = .7) + #position
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(Freq*100,0),"%")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 4) + #add percentages
  ylab("Proportion of conversions") + xlab("Agent") + # specify axis labels
  theme_bw()
```

... or using the ```mosaicplot()``` function:

```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "proportion of conversions per agent (mosaic plot)"}
contigency_table <- table(call_center)
mosaicplot(contigency_table, main = "Proportion of conversions by agent")
```

## Confidence intervals for proportions

Recall that we can use confidence intervals to determine the range of values that the true population parameter will take with a certain level of confidence based on the sample. Similar to the confidence interval for means, we can compute a confidence interval for proportions. The (1-$\alpha$)% confidence interval for proportions is approximately 

$$
CI = p\pm z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\sqrt{\frac{p*(1-p)}{N}}
$$

where $\sqrt{p(1-p)}$ is the equivalent to the standard deviation in the formula for the confidence interval for means. Based on the equation, it is easy to compute the confidence intervals for the conversion rates of the call center agents:

```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
n1 <- nrow(subset(call_center,agent=="agent_1")) #number of observations for agent 1
n2 <- nrow(subset(call_center,agent=="agent_2")) #number of observations for agent 1
n1_conv <- nrow(subset(call_center,agent=="agent_1" & conversion=="yes")) #number of conversions for agent 1
n2_conv <- nrow(subset(call_center,agent=="agent_2" & conversion=="yes")) #number of conversions for agent 2
p1 <- n1_conv/n1  #proportion of conversions for agent 1
p2 <- n2_conv/n2  #proportion of conversions for agent 2

error1 <- qnorm(0.975)*sqrt((p1*(1-p1))/n1)
ci_lower1 <- p1 - error1
ci_upper1 <- p1 + error1
ci_lower1
ci_upper1

error2 <- qnorm(0.975)*sqrt((p2*(1-p2))/n2)
ci_lower2 <- p2 - error2
ci_upper2 <- p2 + error2
ci_lower2
ci_upper2
```

Similar to testing for differences in means, we could also ask: Is agent 1 twice as likely as agent 2 to convert a customer? Or, to state it formally:

$$H_0: \pi_1=\pi_2 \\
H_1: \pi_1\ne \pi_2$$ 

where $\pi$ denotes the population parameter associated with the proportion in the respective population. One approach to test this is based on confidence intervals to estimate the difference between two populations. We can compute an approximate confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of successes in group 1 and group 2, as:

$$
CI = p_1-p_2\pm z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}*\sqrt{\frac{p_1*(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2*(1-p_2)}{n_2}}
$$ 

If the confidence interval includes zero, then the data does not suggest a difference between the groups. Let's compute the confidence interval for differences in the proportions by hand first:

```{r}
ci_lower <- p1 - p2 - qnorm(0.975)*sqrt(p1*(1 - p1)/n1 + p2*(1 - p2)/n2) #95% CI lower bound
ci_upper <- p1 - p2 + qnorm(0.975)*sqrt(p1*(1 - p1)/n1 + p2*(1 - p2)/n2) #95% CI upper bound
ci_lower
ci_upper
```

Now we can see that the 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference between the proportion of conversions for agent 1 and the proportion of conversions for agent 2 is between `r round(ci_lower*100,0)`% and `r round(ci_upper*100,0)`%. This interval tells us the range of plausible values for the difference between the two population proportions. According to this interval, zero is not a plausible value for the difference (i.e., interval does not cross zero), so we reject the null hypothesis that the population proportions are the same.

Instead of computing the intervals by hand, we could also use the ```prop.test()``` function:

```{r}
prop.test(x = c(n1_conv, n2_conv), n = c(n1, n2), conf.level = 0.95)
```

Note that the ```prop.test()``` function uses a slightly different (more accurate) way to compute the confidence interval (Wilson's score method is used). It is particularly a better approximation for smaller N. That's why the confidence interval in the output slightly deviates from the manual computation above, which uses the Wald interval. 

You can also see that the output from the ```prop.test()``` includes the results from a &chi;<sup>2</sup> test for the equality of proportions (which will be  discussed below) and the associated p-value. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of equal probability. Thus, the reporting would be: 

The test showed that the conversion rate for agent 1 was higher by `r round(((prop.test(x = c(n1_conv, n2_conv), n = c(n1, n2), conf.level = 0.95)$estimate[1])-(prop.test(x = c(n1_conv, n2_conv), n = c(n1, n2), conf.level = 0.95)$estimate[2]))*100,0)`%. This difference is significant &chi; (1) = 70, p < .05 (95% CI = [`r round(prop.test(x = c(n1_conv, n2_conv), n = c(n1, n2), conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int[1],2)`,`r round(prop.test(x = c(n1_conv, n2_conv), n = c(n1, n2), conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int[2],2)`]).


## Chi-square test

In the previous section, we saw how we can compute the confidence interval for the difference between proportions to decide on whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. Whenever you would like to investigate the relationship between two categorical variables, the $\chi^2$ test may be used to test whether the variables are independent of each other. It achieves this by comparing the expected number of observations in a group to the actual values. Let's continue with the example from the previous section. Under the null hypothesis, the two variables *agent* and *conversion* in our contingency table are independent (i.e., there is no relationship). This means that the frequency in each field will be roughly proportional to the probability of an observation being in that category, calculated under the assumption that they are independent. The difference between that expected quantity and the actual quantity can be used to construct the test statistic. The test statistic is computed as follows:

$$
\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^{J}\frac{(f_o-f_e)^2}{f_e}
$$

where $J$ is the number of cells in the contingency table, $f_o$ are the observed cell frequencies and $f_e$ are the expected cell frequencies. The larger the differences, the larger the test statistic and the smaller the p-value. 

The observed cell frequencies can easily be seen from the contingency table: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
obs_cell1 <- contigency_table[1,1]
obs_cell2 <- contigency_table[1,2]
obs_cell3 <- contigency_table[2,1]
obs_cell4 <- contigency_table[2,2]
```

The expected cell frequencies can be calculated as follows:

$$
f_e=\frac{(n_r*n_c)}{n}
$$

where $n_r$ are the total observed frequencies per row, $n_c$ are the total observed frequencies per column, and $n$ is the total number of observations. Thus, the expected cell frequencies under the assumption of independence can be calculated as: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
n <- nrow(call_center)
exp_cell1 <- (nrow(call_center[call_center$agent=="agent_1",])*nrow(call_center[call_center$conversion=="no",]))/n
exp_cell2 <- (nrow(call_center[call_center$agent=="agent_1",])*nrow(call_center[call_center$conversion=="yes",]))/n
exp_cell3 <- (nrow(call_center[call_center$agent=="agent_2",])*nrow(call_center[call_center$conversion=="no",]))/n
exp_cell4 <- (nrow(call_center[call_center$agent=="agent_2",])*nrow(call_center[call_center$conversion=="yes",]))/n
```

To sum up, these are the expected cell frequencies

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
data.frame(conversion_no = rbind(exp_cell1,exp_cell3),conversion_yes = rbind(exp_cell2,exp_cell4), row.names = c("agent_1","agent_2")) 
```

... and these are the observed cell frequencies

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print = FALSE}
data.frame(conversion_no = rbind(obs_cell1,obs_cell2),conversion_yes = rbind(obs_cell3,obs_cell4), row.names = c("agent_1","agent_2")) 
```

To obtain the test statistic, we simply plug the values into the formula: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chisq_cal <-  sum(((obs_cell1 - exp_cell1)^2/exp_cell1),
                  ((obs_cell2 - exp_cell2)^2/exp_cell2),
                  ((obs_cell3 - exp_cell3)^2/exp_cell3),
                  ((obs_cell4 - exp_cell4)^2/exp_cell4))
chisq_cal
```

The test statistic is $\chi^2$ distributed. The chi-square distribution is a non-symmetric distribution. Actually, there are many different chi-square distributions, one for each degree of freedom as show in the following figure. 

```{r echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=T, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "The chi-square distribution"}
library(ggplot2)
a <- seq(2,10, 2)
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,20)), aes(x))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(8), aes(colour = '8'))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(1), aes(colour = '1'))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(2), aes(colour = '2'))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(4), aes(colour = '4'))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(6), aes(colour = '6'))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(15), aes(colour = '15'))+
  ylim(min=0, max=0.6) +
  labs(colour = 'Degrees of Freedom', x = 'Value', y = 'Density') + theme_bw()
```

You can see that as the degrees of freedom increase, the chi-square curve approaches a normal distribution. To find the critical value, we need to specify the corresponding degrees of freedom, given by:

$$
df=(r-1)*(c-1)
$$

where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns in the contingency table. Recall that degrees of freedom are generally the number of values that can vary freely when calculating a statistic. In a 2 by 2 table as in our case, we have 2 variables (or two samples) with 2 levels and in each one we have 1 that vary freely. Hence, in our example the degrees of freedom can be calculated as:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <-  (nrow(contigency_table) - 1) * (ncol(contigency_table) -1)
df
```

Now, we can derive the critical value given the degrees of freedom and the level of confidence using the ```qchisq()``` function and test if the calculated test statistic is larger than the critical value:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chisq_crit <- qchisq(0.95, df)
chisq_crit
chisq_cal > chisq_crit
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Visual depiction of the test result"}
df <- 1
p <- 0.95
min <- 0
max <- 15
chsq1 <- round(qchisq(p,df=df), digits = 3)
t2 <- round(qt(p2,df=df), digits = 3)
plot1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(min, max)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df))+
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df), xlim = c(qchisq(p,df=df),max), geom = "area") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, chsq1, chisq_cal)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = chisq_cal, color = "red") +
  labs(title = paste0("Result of chi-square test: reject H0"),
         subtitle = paste0("Red line: Calculated test statistic;"," Black area: Rejection region"),
         x = "x", y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  theme_bw()
plot1
```

We could also compute the p-value using the ```pchisq()``` function, which tells us the probability of the observed cell frequencies if the null hypothesis was true (i.e., there was no association):

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p_val <- 1-pchisq(chisq_cal,df)
p_val
```

The test statistic can also be calculated in R directly on the contingency table with the function ```chisq.test()```.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chisq.test(contigency_table, correct = FALSE)
```

Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05 (i.e., the calculated test statistic is larger than the critical value), we reject H<sub>0</sub> that the two variables are independent. 

Note that the test statistic is sensitive to the sample size. To see this, let's assume that we have a sample of 100 observations instead of 1000 observations:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chisq.test(contigency_table/10, correct = FALSE)
```

You can see that even though the proportions haven't changed, the test is insignificant now. The following equation lets you compute a measure of the effect size, which is insensitive to sample size: 

$$
\phi=\sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n}}
$$

The following guidelines are used to determine the magnitude of the effect size (Cohen, 1988): 

* 0.1 (small effect)
* 0.3 (medium effect)
* 0.5 (large effect)

In our example, we can compute the effect sizes for the large and small samples as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
test_stat <- chisq.test(contigency_table, correct = FALSE)$statistic
phi1 <- sqrt(test_stat/n)
test_stat <- chisq.test(contigency_table/10, correct = FALSE)$statistic
phi2 <- sqrt(test_stat/(n/10))
phi1
phi2
```

You can see that the statistic is insensitive to the sample size. 

Note that the &Phi; coefficient is appropriate for two dichotomous variables (resulting from a 2 x 2 table as above). If any your nominal variables has more than two categories, Cramér's V should be used instead:

$$
V=\sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n*df_{min}}}
$$

where $df_{min}$ refers to the degrees of freedom associated with the variable that has fewer categories (e.g., if we have two nominal variables with 3 and 4 categories, $df_{min}$ would be 3 - 1 = 2). The degrees of freedom need to be taken into account when judging the magnitude of the effect sizes (see e.g., <a href="http://www.real-statistics.com/chi-square-and-f-distributions/effect-size-chi-square/" target="_blank">here</a>). 

Note that the ```correct = FALSE``` argument above ensures that the test statistic is computed in the same way as we have done by hand above. By default, ```chisq.test()``` applies a correction to prevent overestimation of statistical significance for small data (called the Yates' correction). The correction is implemented by subtracting the value 0.5 from the computed difference between the observed and expected cell counts in the numerator of the test statistic. This means that the calculated test statistic will be smaller (i.e., more conservative). Although the adjustment may go too far in some instances, you should generally rely on the adjusted results, which can be computed as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
chisq.test(contigency_table)
```

As you can see, the results don't change much in our example, since the differences between the observed and expected cell frequencies are fairly large relative to the correction.

Caution is warranted when the cell counts in the contingency table are small. The usual rule of thumb is that all cell counts should be at least 5 (this may be a little too stringent though). When some cell counts are too small, you can use Fisher's exact test using the ```fisher.test()``` function. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fisher.test(contigency_table)
```

The Fisher test, while more conservative, also shows a significant difference between the proportions (p < 0.05). This is not surprising since the cell counts in our example are fairly large.

## Sample size


To **calculate the required sample size** when comparing proportions, the ```power.prop.test()``` function can be used. For example, we could ask how large our sample needs to be if we would like to compare two groups with conversion rates of 2% and 2.5%, respectively using the conventional settings for $\alpha$ and $\beta$:

```{r}
power.prop.test(p1=0.02,p2=0.025,sig.level=0.05,power=0.8)
```

The output tells us that we need `r round(power.prop.test(p1=0.02,p2=0.025,sig.level=0.05,power=0.8)$n,0)` observations per group to detect a difference of the desired size.

### Summary

* Confidence interval for proportions: the interval that shows the range of plausible values for the difference between the two population proportions. If the interval does not cross zero, then zero is not a plausible value for the difference between two proportions, and we reject the null hypothesis that the population proportions are the same.

* Application of the Chi-square test: when there are 2 categorical variables (ordinal or nominal). In our example: conversion (yes or no) and agent (1 or 2).
* Hypothesis: Is there an association between categorical variable X (e.g. conversion) and categorical variable Y (e.g. agent)?
 H0: There is no association between the two variables.
 H1: There is an association between the two variables.
* Interpretation: If we find an association between two variables (p < 0.05), we can conclude that the propotion of conversions to proportion of non-conversions between agent 1 and agent 2 significantly differ. 

* Example of application in marketing: Marketing department of a firm producing toilet paper is interested in studying the consumer behavior in the context of purchase decision. The company is planing to launch a high quality, super soft toilet paper, but beforehand they decided to conduct a research. They are interested in knowing whether the income level of their consumers influence their choice of the toilet paper quality or not. Currently there are 4 income categories the comapany's consumers are assigned to, and  4 different levels of toilet paper quality. (4x4 table)


# Correlation

Before we start with regression analysis, we will review the basic concept of correlation first. Correlation helps us to determine the degree to which the variation in one variable, X, is related to the variation in another variable, Y. 

## Correlation coefficient

The correlation coefficient summarizes the strength of the linear relationship between two metric (interval or ratio scaled) variables. Let's consider a simple example. Say you conduct a survey to investigate the relationship between the attitude towards a city and the duration of residency. The "Attitude" variable can take values between 1 (very unfavorable) and 12 (very favorable), and the "duration of residency" is measured in years. Let's further assume for this example that the attitude measurement represents an interval scale (although it is usually not realistic to assume that the scale points on an itemized rating scale have the same distance). To keep it simple, let's further assume that you only asked 12 people. We can create a short data set like this:  

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(openssl)
passphrase <- charToRaw("MRDAnils")
key <- sha256(passphrase)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/mrda_data_pub/master/secret-music_data.rds"
download.file(url, "./data/secret_music_data.rds", method = "auto", quiet=FALSE)
encrypted_music_data <- readRDS("./data/secret_music_data.rds")
music_data <- unserialize(aes_cbc_decrypt(encrypted_music_data, key = key))
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
readRDS("music_data.rds")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
s.genre <- c("pop","hip hop","rock","rap","indie")
music_data <- subset(music_data, top.genre %in% s.genre)

music_data$genre_cat <- as.factor(music_data$top.genre)
music_data$explicit_cat <- factor(music_data$explicit, levels = c(0:1), 
    labels = c("not explicit", "explicit"))

head(music_data)
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE,paged.print = FALSE}
#library(psych)
#attitude <- c(6,9,8,3,10,4,5,2,11,9,10,2)
#duration <- c(10,12,12,4,12,6,8,2,18,9,17,2)
#att_data <- data.frame(attitude, duration)
#att_data <- att_data[order(-attitude), ]
#att_data$respodentID <- c(1:12)
#str(att_data)
#psych::describe(att_data[, c("attitude","duration")])
#att_data
```

Let's look at the data. The following graph shows the individual data points for the "duration of residency"" variable, where the blue horizontal line represents the mean of the variable (`r round(mean(music_data$energy, na.rm=T),2)`) and the vertical lines show the distance of the individual data points from the mean.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Scores for duration of residency variable"}
library(ggplot2)
#h <- round(mean(att_data$duration), 2)

ggplot(music_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(energy), bins = 50, fill = 'white', color = 'deepskyblue4') +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(energy, na.rm=T)), color='black', size=1) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of energy",
       #subtitle = TeX(sprintf("Population mean ($\\mu$) = %.2f; population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) = %.2f",round(mean(hours),2),round(sd(hours),2))),
       y = 'Number of observations', 
       x = 'Energy') +
  theme_bw()

#ggplot(music_data, aes(y = energy)) + 
#  geom_point(size = 3, color = "deepskyblue4") + 
#  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) + 
#  geom_hline(data = att_data, aes(yintercept = mean(duration)), color ="deepskyblue4") +
#  labs(x = "Observations",y = "Duration of residency", size = 11) +
#  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 18)) +
#  geom_segment(aes(x = respodentID,y = duration, xend = respodentID, 
#                   yend = mean(duration)), color = "deepskyblue4", size = 1) + 
#  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
#        axis.text  = element_text(size=16),
#        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 16),
#        legend.position="none") + 
#  theme_bw()
```

You can see that there are some respondents that have been living in the city longer than average and some respondents that have been living in the city shorter than average. Let's do the same for the second variable ("Attitude"): 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Scores for attitude variable"}

ggplot(music_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(loudness), bins = 50, fill = 'white', color = '#f9756d') +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(energy, na.rm=T)), color='black', size=1) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of loudness",
       #subtitle = TeX(sprintf("Population mean ($\\mu$) = %.2f; population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) = %.2f",round(mean(hours),2),round(sd(hours),2))),
       y = 'Number of observations', 
       x = 'Loudness') +
  theme_bw()


#ggplot(att_data, aes(x = respodentID, y = attitude)) + 
#  geom_point(size = 3, color = "#f9756d") + 
#  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) + 
#  geom_hline(data = att_data, aes(yintercept = mean(attitude)), color = "#f9756d") +
#  labs(x = "Observations",y = "Attitude", size = 11) +
#  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,18)) +
#  geom_segment(aes(x = respodentID, y = attitude, xend = respodentID, 
#                   yend = mean(attitude)), color = "#f9756d", size = 1) + 
#  theme_bw()
```

Again, we can see that some respondents have an above average attitude towards the city (more favorable) and some respondents have a below average attitude towards the city. Let's plot the data in one graph now to see if there is some co-movement: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Scores for attitude and duration of residency variables"}

ggplot(music_data, aes(energy, loudness)) + 
#  geom_point(size = 3, aes(id, energy), color = "#f9756d") +
#  geom_point(size = 3, aes(id, loudness), color = "deepskyblue4")  + 
   geom_point() +
#  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) + 
#  geom_hline(data = att_data, aes(yintercept = mean(duration)), color = "deepskyblue4") +
#  geom_hline(data = att_data, aes(yintercept = mean(attitude)), color = "#f9756d") +
  labs(x = "Observations", y = "Duration/Attitude", size = 11) +
#  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 18)) +
#  scale_color_manual(values = c("#f9756d", "deepskyblue4")) +
  theme_bw()

#ggplot(att_data) + 
#  geom_point(size = 3, aes(respodentID, attitude), color = "#f9756d") +
#  geom_point(size = 3, aes(respodentID, duration), color = "deepskyblue4")  + 
#  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) + 
#  geom_hline(data = att_data, aes(yintercept = mean(duration)), color = "deepskyblue4") +
#  geom_hline(data = att_data, aes(yintercept = mean(attitude)), color = "#f9756d") +
#  labs(x = "Observations", y = "Duration/Attitude", size = 11) +
#  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 18)) +
#  scale_color_manual(values = c("#f9756d", "deepskyblue4")) +
#  theme_bw()
```

We can see that there is indeed some co-movement here. The variables <b>covary</b> because respondents who have an above (below) average attitude towards the city also appear to have been living in the city for an above (below) average amount of time and vice versa. Correlation helps us to quantify this relationship. Before you proceed to compute the correlation coefficient, you should first look at the data. We usually use a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between two metric variables:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Scatterplot for duration and attitute variables"}
#ggplot(att_data) + 
#  geom_point(size = 3, aes(duration, attitude)) + 
#  labs(x = "Duration",y = "Attitude", size = 11) +
#  theme_bw()
```

How can we compute the correlation coefficient? Remember that the variance measures the average deviation from the mean of a variable:

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
s_x^2&=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_i-\overline{X})^2}{N-1} \\
     &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_i-\overline{X})*(X_i-\overline{X})}{N-1}
\end{split}
(\#eq:variance)
\end{equation} 

When we consider two variables, we multiply the deviation for one variable by the respective deviation for the second variable: 

<p style="text-align:center;">
$(X_i-\overline{X})*(Y_i-\overline{Y})$
</p>

This is called the cross-product deviation. Then we sum the cross-product deviations:

<p style="text-align:center;">
$\sum_{i=1}^{N}(X_i-\overline{X})*(Y_i-\overline{Y})$
</p>

... and compute the average of the sum of all cross-product deviations to get the <b>covariance</b>:

\begin{equation} 
Cov(x, y) =\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(X_i-\overline{X})*(Y_i-\overline{Y})}{N-1}
(\#eq:covariance)
\end{equation} 

You can easily compute the covariance manually as follows

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
x <- music_data$energy[!is.na(music_data$energy)]
x_bar <- mean(music_data$energy, na.rm = T)
y <- music_data$loudness[!is.na(music_data$loudness)]
y_bar <- mean(music_data$loudness, na.rm = T)
N <- nrow(music_data)
cov <- (sum((x - x_bar)*(y - y_bar))) / (N - 1)
cov
```

Or you simply use the built-in ```cov()``` function:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cov(x, y)          # apply the cov function 
```

A positive covariance indicates that as one variable deviates from the mean, the other variable deviates in the same direction. A negative covariance indicates that as one variable deviates from the mean (e.g., increases), the other variable deviates in the opposite direction (e.g., decreases).

However, the size of the covariance depends on the scale of measurement. Larger scale units will lead to larger covariance. To overcome the problem of dependence on measurement scale, we need to convert covariance to a standard set of units through standardization by dividing the covariance by the standard deviation (i.e., similar to how we compute z-scores).

With two variables, there are two standard deviations. We simply multiply the two standard deviations. We then divide the covariance by the product of the two standard deviations to get the standardized covariance, which is known as a correlation coefficient r:

\begin{equation} 
r=\frac{Cov_{xy}}{s_x*s_y}
(\#eq:corcoeff)
\end{equation} 

This is known as the product moment correlation (r) and it is straight-forward to compute:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
x_sd <- sd(music_data$energy, na.rm = T)
y_sd <- sd(music_data$loudness, na.rm = T)
r <- cov/(x_sd*y_sd)
r
```

Or you could just use the ```cor()``` function:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cor(music_data[, c("energy", "loudness")], method = "pearson", use = "complete")
```

Properties of r:

* ranges from -1 to + 1
* +1 indicates perfect linear relationship
* -1 indicates perfect negative relationship
* 0 indicates no linear relationship
* ± .1 represents small effect
* ± .3 represents medium effect
* ± .5 represents large effect

## Significance testing

How can we determine if our two variables are significantly related? To test this, we denote the population moment correlation &rho;. Then we test the null of no relationship between variables:

$$H_0:\rho=0$$
$$H_1:\rho\ne0$$

The test statistic is: 

\begin{equation} 
t=\frac{r*\sqrt{N-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}
(\#eq:cortest)
\end{equation} 

It has a t distribution with n - 2 degrees of freedom. Then, we follow the usual procedure of calculating the test statistic and comparing the test statistic to the critical value of the underlying probability distribution. If the calculated test statistic is larger than the critical value, the null hypothesis of no relationship between X and Y is rejected. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
t_calc <- r*sqrt(N - 2)/sqrt(1 - r^2) #calculated test statistic
t_calc
df <- (N - 2) #degrees of freedom
t_crit <- qt(0.975, df) #critical value
t_crit
pt(q = t_calc, df = df, lower.tail = F) * 2 #p-value 
```

Or you can simply use the ```cor.test()``` function, which also produces the 95% confidence interval:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cor.test(music_data$energy, music_data$loudness, alternative = "two.sided", method = "pearson", conf.level = 0.95)
```

To determine the linear relationship between variables, the data only needs to be measured using interval scales. If you want to test the significance of the association, the sampling distribution needs to be normally distributed (we usually assume this when our data are normally distributed or when N is large). If parametric assumptions are violated, you should use non-parametric tests:

* Spearman's correlation coefficient: requires ordinal data and ranks the data before applying Pearson's equation.
* Kendall's tau: use when N is small or the number of tied ranks is large.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cor.test(music_data$energy, music_data$loudness, alternative = "two.sided", method = "spearman", conf.level = 0.95)
cor.test(music_data$energy, music_data$loudness, alternative = "two.sided", method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)
```

Report the results:

A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was computed to assess the relationship between the duration of residence in a city and the attitude toward the city. There was a positive correlation between the two variables, r = 0.936, n = 12, p < 0.05. A scatterplot summarizes the results (Figure XY).

**A note on the interpretation of correlation coefficients:**

Correlation coefficients give no indication of the direction of causality. In our example, we can conclude that the attitude toward the city is more positive as the years of residence increases. However, we cannot say that the years of residence cause the attitudes to be more positive. There are two main reasons for caution when interpreting correlations:

* Third-variable problem: there may be other unobserved factors that affect the results.
* Direction of causality: Correlations say nothing about which variable causes the other to change (reverse causality: attitudes may just as well cause the years of residence variable).

### Summary

* Correlation (Pearson’s) can be observed between 2 or more continuous variables (interval or ratio). If we apply Pearson’s equation on ordinal data, which we ranked beforehand, we will obtain Spearman’s correlation coefficient.
* Correlation helps us to determine the degree to which the variation in one variable, X, is related to the variation in another variable, Y.
* A raw measure of the relationship between variables is the covariance.
* If we standardize the covariance (divide by the product of the two standard deviations) we get Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r.
* The correlation coefficient can be between −1 and +1.
* +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship; −1 indicates a perfect negative relationship; 0 indicates no linear relationship at all.
* The correlation coefficient is a commonly used measure of the size of an effect: values of +/-0.1 are considered a small effect, +/-0.3 a medium effect and +/-0.5 a large effect. However, an interpretation of the size of correlation should be made based on the context of the research rather than on following these benchmarks.
* Correlation coefficients give no indication of the direction of causality.
* Consideration of the third-variable problem necessary when interpreting correlation as there might be other unobserved variables that influence the results

# T-Test
This chapter is primarily based on Field, A., Miles J., & Field, Z. (2012): Discovering Statistics Using R. Sage Publications, **chapter 9**.

## One sample t-test

The example we used in the introduction was an example of the **one sample t-test** and we computed all statistics by hand to explain the underlying intuition. When you conduct hypothesis tests using R, you do not need to calculate these statistics by hand, since there are build-in routines to conduct the steps for you. Let us use the same example again to see how you would conduct hypothesis tests in R.  

**1. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses**

The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the true population mean $\mu$ and the hypothesized value (i.e., $10$), while the alternative hypothesis states the opposite: 

$$
H_0: \mu = 10 \\
H_1: \mu \neq 10
$$

**2. Select an appropriate test**

Because we would like to test if the mean of a variable is different from a specified threshold, the one-sample t-test is appropriate. The assumptions of the test are 1) that the variable is measured using an interval or ratio scale, and 2) that the sampling distribution is normal. Both assumptions are met since 1) listening time is a ratio scale, and 2) we deem the sample size (n = 50) large enough to assume a normal sampling distribution according to the central limit theorem.  

**3. Choose the level of significance**

We choose the conventional 5% significance level. 

**4. Descriptive statistics and data visualization**

Provide descriptive statistics using the ```stat.desc()``` function: 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pastecs)
stat.desc(student_sample)
```

From this, we can already see that the mean is different from the hypothesized value. The question however remains, whether this difference is significantly different, given the sample size and the variability in the data. Since we only have one continuous variable, we can visualize the distribution in a histogram. 

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(student_sample)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = student_sample), fill = 'white', color = 'black', bins = 20) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of values in the sample",x = "Hours", y = "Frequency") 
```

**5. Conduct significance test**

In the beginning of the chapter, we saw, how you could conduct significance test by hand. However, R has built-in routines that you can use to conduct the analyses. The ```t.test()``` function can be used to conduct the test. To test if the listening time among WU students was 10, you can use the following code:

```{r}
H_0 <- 10
t.test(student_sample, mu = H_0, alternative = 'two.sided')
```

Note that if you would have stated a directional hypothesis (i.e., the mean is either greater or smaller than 10 hours), you could easily amend the code to conduct a one sided test by changing the argument ```alternative```from ```'two.sided'``` to either ```'less'``` or ```'greater'```.

**6. Report results and draw a marketing conclusion**

Note that the results are the same as above, when we computed the test by hand. You could summarize the results as follows:

On average, the listening times in our sample were different form 10 hours per month (Mean = 18.99 hours, SE = 1.78). This difference was significant t(49) = 5.058, p < .05 (95% CI = [15.42; 22.56]). Based on this evidence, we can conclude that the mean in our sample is significantly lower compared to the hypothesized population mean of $10$ hours, providing evidence against the null hypothesis. 

Note that in the reporting above, the number ```49``` in parenthesis refers to the degrees of freedom that are available from the output. 

## Comparing two means

In the one-sample test above, we tested the hypothesis that the population mean has some specific value $\mu_0$ using data from only one sample. In marketing (as in many other disciplines), you will often be confronted with a situation where you wish to compare the means of two groups. For example, you may conduct an experiment and randomly split your sample into two groups, one of which receives a treatment (experimental group) while the other doesn't (control group). In this case, the units (e.g., participants, products) in each group are different ('between-subjects design') and the samples are said to be independent. Hence, we would use a **independent-means t-test**. If you run an experiment with two experimental conditions and the same units (e.g., participants, products) were observed in both experimental conditions, the sample is said to be dependent in the sense that you have the same units in each group ('within-subjects design'). In this case, we would need to conduct an **dependent-means t-test**. Both tests are described in the following sections, beginning with the independent-means t-test.      

### Independent-means t-test

Using an independent-means t-test, we can compare the means of two possibly different populations. It is, for example, quite common for online companies to test new service features by running an experiment and randomly splitting their website visitors into two groups: one is exposed to the website with the new feature (experimental group) and the other group is not exposed to the new feature (control group). This is a typical A/B-Test scenario.

As an example, imagine that a music streaming service would like to introduce a new playlist feature that let's their users access playlists created by other users. The goal is to analyse how the new service feature impacts the listening time of users. The service randomly splits a representative subset of their users into two groups and collects data about their listening times over one month. Let's create a data set to simulate such a scenario. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(321)
hours_population_1 <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2, scale = 10)
set.seed(12567)
sample_1 <- sample(1:25000, size = 98, replace = FALSE)
sample_1_hours <- hours_population_1[sample_1]
sample_1_df <- data.frame(hours = round(sample_1_hours,0), group = "A")
set.seed(321)
hours_population_2 <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2.5, scale = 11)
set.seed(12567)
sample_2 <- sample(1:25000, size = 112, replace = FALSE)
sample_2_hours <- hours_population_2[sample_2]
sample_2_df <- data.frame(hours = round(sample_2_hours,0), group = "B")
hours_a_b <- rbind(sample_1_df,sample_2_df) 
head(hours_a_b)
```

This data set contains two variables: the variable ```hours``` indicates the music listening times (in hours) and the variable ```group``` indicates from which group the observation comes, where 'A' refers to the control group (with the standard service) and 'B' refers to the experimental group (with the new playlist feature). Let's first look at the descriptive statistics by group using the ```describeBy``` function:

```{r}
library(psych)
describeBy(hours_a_b$hours, hours_a_b$group)
```

From this, we can already see that there is a difference in means between groups A and B. We can also see that the number of observations is different, as is the standard deviation. The question that we would like to answer is whether there is a significant difference in mean listening times between the groups. Remember that different users are contained in each group ('between-subjects design') and that the observations in one group are independent of the observations in the other group. Before we will see how you can easily conduct an independent-means t-test, let's go over some theory first.

#### Theory

As a starting point, let us label the unknown population mean of group A (control group) in our experiment $\mu_1$, and that of group B (experimental group) $\mu_2$. In this setting, the null hypothesis would state that the mean in group A is equal to the mean in group B:

$$
H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2
$$

This is equivalent to stating that the difference between the two groups ($\delta$) is zero:

$$
H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2=0=\delta
$$

That is, $\delta$ is the new unknown population parameter, so that the null and alternative hypothesis become:   

$$
H_0: \delta = 0 \\
H_1: \delta \ne 0
$$

Remember that we usually don't have access to the entire population so that we can not observe $\delta$ and have to estimate is from a sample statistic, which we define as $d = \bar x_1-\bar x_2$, i.e., the difference between the sample means from group a ($\bar x_1$) and group b ($\bar x_2$). But can we really estimate $d$ from $\delta$? Remember from the previous chapter, that we could estimate $\mu$ from $\bar x$, because if we (hypothetically) take a larger number of samples, the distribution of the means of these samples (the sampling distribution) will be normally distributed and its mean will be (in the limit) equal to the population mean. It turns out that we can use the same underlying logic here. The above samples were drawn from two different populations with $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. Let us compute the difference in means between these two populations:       

```{r}
delta_pop <- mean(hours_population_1)-mean(hours_population_2)
delta_pop
```

This means that the true difference between the mean listening times of groups a and b is `r round(delta_pop,2)`. Let us now repeat the exercise from the previous chapter: let us repeatedly draw a large number of $20,000$ random samples of 100 users from each of these populations, compute the difference (i.e., $d$, our estimate of $\delta$), store the difference for each draw and create a histogram of $d$.

```{r}
set.seed(321)
hours_population_1 <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2, scale = 10)
hours_population_2 <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2.5, scale = 11)

samples <- 20000
mean_delta <- matrix(NA, nrow = samples)
for (i in 1:samples){
  student_sample <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
  mean_delta[i,] <- mean(hours_population_1[student_sample])-mean(hours_population_2[student_sample])
}

ggplot(data.frame(mean_delta)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = mean_delta), bins = 30, fill='white', color='black') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(mean_delta)), size=1) + xlab("d") +
  ggtitle(TeX(sprintf("%d samples; $d_{\\bar{x}}$ = %.2f",samples, round(mean(mean_delta),2))))
```

This gives us the sampling distribution of the mean differences between the samples. You will notice that this distribution follows a normal distribution and is centered around the true difference between the populations. This means that, on average, the difference between two sample means $d$ is a good estimate of $\delta$. In our example, the difference between $\bar x_1$ and $\bar x_2$ is:

```{r}
mean_x1 <- mean(hours_a_b[hours_a_b$group=="A","hours"])
mean_x1
mean_x2 <- mean(hours_a_b[hours_a_b$group=="B","hours"])
mean_x2
d <- mean_x1-mean_x2
d 
```

Now that we have $d$ as an estimate of $\delta$, how can we find out if the observed difference is significantly different from the null hypothesis (i.e., $\delta = 0$)?

Recall from the previous section, that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution $\sigma_{\bar x}$ (i.e., the standard error) gives us indication about the precision of our estimate. Further recall that the standard error can be calculated as $\sigma_{\bar x}={\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}$. So how can we calculate the standard error of the difference between two population means? According to the **variance sum law**, to find the variance of the sampling distribution of differences, we merely need to add together the variances of the sampling distributions of the two populations that we are comparing. To find the standard error, we only need to take the square root of the variance (because the standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance), so that we get:

$$
\sigma_{\bar x_1-\bar x_2} = \sqrt{{\sigma_1^2 \over n_1}+{\sigma_2^2 \over n_2}}
$$

But recall that we don't actually know the true population standard deviation, so we use $SE_{\bar x_1-\bar x_2}$ as an estimate of $\sigma_{\bar x_1-\bar x_2}$:

$$
SE_{\bar x_1-\bar x_2} = \sqrt{{s_1^2 \over n_1}+{s_2^2 \over n_2}}
$$

Hence, for our example, we can calculate the standard error as follows: 

```{r}
n1 <- 98
n2 <- 112
s1 <- var(hours_a_b[hours_a_b$group=="A","hours"])
s1
s2 <- var(hours_a_b[hours_a_b$group=="B","hours"])
s2
SE_x1_x2 <- sqrt(s1/n1+s2/n2)
SE_x1_x2
```

Recall from above that we can calculate the t-statistic as:

$$
t= {\bar x - \mu_0 \over {s \over \sqrt{n}}} 
$$

Exchanging $\bar x$ for $d$, we get

$$
t= {(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2) \over {\sqrt{{s_1^2 \over n_1}+{s_2^2 \over n_2}}}} 
$$

Note that according to our hypothesis $\mu_1-\mu_2=0$, so that we can calculate the t-statistic as: 

```{r}
t_score <- d/SE_x1_x2
t_score
```

Following the example of our one sample t-test above, we would now need to compare this calculated test statistic to a critical value in order to assess if $d$ is sufficiently far away from the null hypothesis to be statistically significant. To do this, we would need to know the exact t-distribution, which depends on the degrees of freedom. The problem is that deriving the degrees of freedom in this case is not that obvious. If we were willing to assume that $\sigma_1=\sigma_2$, the correct t-distribution has $n_1 -1 + n_2-1$ degrees of freedom (i.e., the sum of the degrees of freedom of the two samples). However, because in real life we don not know if $\sigma_1=\sigma_2$, we need to account for this additional uncertainty. We will not go into detail here, but R automatically uses a sophisticated approach to correct the degrees of freedom called the Welch's correction, as we will see in the subsequent application. 

#### Application

The section above explained the theory behind the independent-means t-test and showed how to compute the statistics manually. Obviously you don't have to compute these statistics by hand in this section shows you how to conduct an independent-means t-test in R using the example from above.  

**1. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses**

We wish to analyze whether there is a significant difference in music listening times between groups A and B. So our null hypothesis is that the means from the two populations are the same (i.e., there is no difference), while the alternative hypothesis states the opposite:   

$$
H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2\\
H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2
$$

**2. Select an appropriate test**

Since we have a ratio scaled variable (i.e., listening times) and two independent groups, where the mean of one sample is independent of the group of the second sample (i.e., the groups contain different units), the independent-means t-test is appropriate. 

**3. Choose the level of significance**

We choose the conventional 5% significance level. 

**4. Descriptive statistics and data visualization**

We can compute the descriptive statistics for each group separately, using the ```describeBy()``` function:

```{r}
library(psych)
describeBy(hours_a_b$hours, hours_a_b$group)
```

This already shows us that the mean between groups A and B are different. We can visualize the data using a plot of means, boxplot, and a histogram. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(hours_a_b,aes(group, hours)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "summary",  color = "black", fill = "white", width = 0.7) +
  geom_pointrange(stat = "summary") + 
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Listening time (hours)") +
  ggtitle("Means and standard errors of listening times") +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(hours_a_b, aes(x = group, y = hours)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Listening time (hours)") + 
  ggtitle("Boxplot of listening times") +
  theme_bw() 

ggplot(hours_a_b,aes(hours)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "black", fill = "darkblue") + 
  labs(x = "Listening time (hours)", y = "Frequency") + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of listening times") +
  facet_wrap(~group) +
  theme_bw()
```

**5. Conduct significance test**

To conduct the independent means t-test, we can use the ```t.test()``` function:

```{r}
t.test(hours ~ group, data = hours_a_b, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, var.equal = FALSE)
```

**6. Report results and draw a marketing conclusion**

The results showed that listening times were higher in the experimental group (Mean = 26.43, SE = 1.54) compared to the control group (Mean = 20.91, SE = 1.37). This means that the listening times were `r abs(round(d,2))` hours higher on average in the experimental group, compared to the control group. An independent-means t-test showed that this difference is significant t(207) = 2.684, p < .05 (95% CI = [1.46,9.58]).


### Dependent-means t-test

While the independent-means t-test is used when different units (e.g., participants, products) were assigned to the different condition, the **dependent-means t-test** is used when there are two experimental conditions and the same units (e.g., participants, products) were observed in both experimental conditions.

Imagine, for example, a slightly different experimental setup for the above experiment. Imagine that we do not assign different users to the groups, but that a sample of 100 users gets to use the music streaming service with the new feature for one month and we compare the music listening times of these users during the month of the experiment with the listening time in the previous month. Let us generate data for this example: 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(321)
hours_population_1 <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2, scale = 10)
set.seed(12567)
sample_1 <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
sample_1_hours <- hours_population_1[sample_1]
set.seed(321)
hours_population_2 <- rgamma(25000, shape = 2.5, scale = 11)
set.seed(12567)
sample_2 <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
sample_2_hours <- hours_population_2[sample_2]
hours_a_b_paired <- data.frame(hours_a = round(sample_1_hours,0),hours_b = round(sample_2_hours,0)) 
head(hours_a_b_paired)
```

Note that the data set has almost the same structure as before only that we know have two variables representing the listening times of each user in the month before the experiment and during the month of the experiment when the new feature was tested.

#### Theory

In this case, we want to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in mean the mean listening times between the two months. This can be expressed as follows:

$$
H_0: \mu_D = 0 \\
$$
Note that the hypothesis only refers to one population, since both observations come from the same units (i.e., users). To use consistent notation, we replace $\mu_D$ with $\delta$ and get:

$$
H_0: \delta = 0 \\
H_1: \delta \neq 0
$$

where $\delta$ denotes the difference between the observed listening times from the two consecutive months **of the same users**. As is the previous example, since we do not observe the entire population, we estimate $\delta$ based on the sample using $d$, which is the difference in mean listening time between the two months for our sample. Note that we assume that everything else (e.g., number of new releases) remained constant over the two month to keep it simple. We can show as above that the sampling distribution follows a normal distribution with a mean that is (in the limit) the same as the population mean. This means, again, that the difference in sample means is a good estimate for the difference in population means. Let's compute a new variable $d$, which is the difference between two month. 

```{r}
hours_a_b_paired$d <- hours_a_b_paired$hours_a - hours_a_b_paired$hours_b
head(hours_a_b_paired)
```

Note that we now have a new variable, which is the difference in listening times (in hours) between the two months. The mean of this difference is:

```{r}
mean_d <- mean(hours_a_b_paired$d)
mean_d
```

Again, we use $SE_{\bar x}$ as an estimate of $\sigma_{\bar x}$:

$$
SE_{\bar d}={s \over \sqrt{n}}
$$
Hence, we can compute the standard error as:

```{r}
n <- nrow(hours_a_b_paired)
SE_d <- sd(hours_a_b_paired$d)/sqrt(n)
SE_d
```

The test statistic is therefore:

$$
t = {\bar d-  \mu_0 \over SE_{\bar d}}
$$
on 99 (i.e., n-1) degrees of freedom. Now we can compute the t-statistic as follows:

```{r}
t_score <- mean_d/SE_d
t_score
qt(0.975,df=99)
```

Note that in the case of the dependent-means t-test, we only base our hypothesis on one population and hence there is only one population variance. This is because in the dependent sample test, the observations come from the same observational units (i.e., users). Hence, there is no unsystematic variation due to potential differences between users that were assigned to the experimental groups. This means that the influence of unobserved factors (unsystematic variation) relative to the variation due to the experimental manipulation (systematic variation) is not as strong in the dependent-means test compared to the independent-means test and we don't need to correct for differences in the population variances. 

#### Application

Again, we don't have to compute all this by hand since the ```t.test(...)``` function can be used to do it for us. Now we have to use the argument ```paired=TRUE``` to let R know that we are working with dependent observations. 

**1. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses**

We would like to the test if there is a difference in music listening times between the two consecutive months, so our null hypothesis is that there is no difference, while the alternative hypothesis states the opposite:

$$
H_0: \mu_D = 0 \\
H_1: \mu_D \ne 0
$$

**2. Select an appropriate test**

Since we have a ratio scaled variable (i.e., listening times) and two observations of the same group of users (i.e., the groups contain the same units), the dependent-means t-test is appropriate. 

**3. Choose the level of significance**

We choose the conventional 5% significance level. 

**4. Descriptive statistics and data visualization**

We can compute the descriptive statistics for each month separately, using the ```describe()``` function:

```{r}
library(psych)
describe(hours_a_b_paired)
```

This already shows us that the mean between the two months are different. We can visiualize the data using a plot of means, boxplot, and a histogram. 

To plot the data, we need to do some restructuring first, since the variables are now stored in two different columns ("hours_a" and "hours_b"). This is also known as the "wide" format. To plot the data we need all observations to be stored in one variable. This is also known as the "long" format. We can use the ```melt(...)``` function from the ```reshape2```package to "melt" the two variable into one column to plot the data. 

```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "plot of means (dependent test)"}
library(reshape2)
hours_a_b_paired_long <- melt(hours_a_b_paired[, c("hours_a", "hours_b")]) 
names(hours_a_b_paired_long) <- c("group","hours")
head(hours_a_b_paired_long)
```

Now we are ready to plot the data:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(hours_a_b_paired_long,aes(group, hours)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "summary",  color = "black", fill = "white", width = 0.7) +
  geom_pointrange(stat = "summary") + 
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Listening time (hours)") +
  ggtitle("Means and standard errors of listining times") +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(hours_a_b_paired_long, aes(x = group, y = hours)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Group", y = "Listening time (hours)") + 
  ggtitle("Boxplot of listening times") +
  theme_bw() 

ggplot(hours_a_b_paired_long,aes(hours)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "black", fill = "darkblue") + 
  labs(x = "Listening time (hours)", y = "Frequency") + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of listening times") +
  facet_wrap(~group) +
  theme_bw()
```

**5. Conduct significance test**

To conduct the independent means t-test, we can use the ```t.test()``` function with the argument ```paired = TRUE```:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
t.test(hours_a_b_paired$hours_a, hours_a_b_paired$hours_b, mu = 0, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95, paired=TRUE)
```


**6. Report results and draw a marketing conclusion**

On average, the same users used the service more when it included the new feature (M = 25.96, SE = 1.68) compared to the service without the feature (M = 20.99, SE = 1.34). This difference was significant t(99) = 2.3781, p < .05 (95% CI = [0.82, 9.12]).


### Summary

* Between-subject experimental design: When you run experiment and randomly split sample into two groups whose members/units/participants are independent of each other (exert no influence on their performance in experiment), one of which receives a treatment (experimental group) while the other doesn’t (control group). In this case we have two independent samples and use independent t-test.

* Within-subject experimental design: If you run an experiment with two experimental conditions and the same participants/units were observed in both experimental conditions, the sample is said to be dependent in the sense that you have the same participants/units in each group. In this case we have two dependent samples and use dependent t-test (Paired test).

* Hypotheses:
H0: The difference between the two (independent or dependent) groups is equal zero.
H1: The difference between the two (independent or dependent) groups is not equal 0.

* Both the independent t-test and the dependent t-test are parametric tests based on the normal distribution. 

* Assumptions for both type of tests:

1) The sampling distribution is normally distributed. In the dependent t-test this means that the sampling distribution of the differences between scores should be normal, not the scores themselves.

2) Data are measured at least at the interval level.

* The independent t-test, because it is used to test independent groups of people, also assumes:

1) Scores in different treatment conditions (control group and test group) are independent (because they come from different participants/units/products).

2) Homogeneity of variance – it assumes equal variances.

* Application in marketing: T-test can help marketing department of retailers to answer questions about their customers’ spending. Since they have collected extensive data about their customers through loyalty program, they may want to use to conduct a research. They might be interested in comparing average amount of Euros spent per purchase between shoppers who live closer (within range of 500 m) and shoppers who live further (more than 500m) from their new outlet. Therefore, they could form the following hypotheses:

H0: There is no difference in a spending per purchase between shoppers who live closer to the outlet and shoppers who live further.
H1: There is a difference in a spending per purchase between shoppers who live closer to the outlet and shoppers who live further.

### Further considerations

#### Type I and Type II Errors

When choosing the level of significance ($\alpha$). It is important to note that the choice of the significance level affects the type 1 and type 2 error:

* Type I error: When we believe there is a genuine effect in our population, when in fact there isn't. Probability of type I error ($\alpha$) = level of significance.
* Type II error: When we believe that there is no effect in the population, when in fact there is. 

This following table shows the possible outcomes of a test (retain vs. reject $H_0$), depending on whether $H_0$ is true or false in reality.

&nbsp; | Retain <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>	 | Reject <b>H<sub>0</sub></b>	
--------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------
<b>H<sub>0</sub> is true</b>  | Correct decision:<br>1-&alpha; (probability of correct retention); | Type 1 error:<br> &alpha; (level of significance)
<b>H<sub>0</sub> is false</b>  | Type 2 error:<br>&beta; (type 2 error rate) | Correct decision:<br>1-&beta; (power of the test)

#### Significance level, sample size, power, and effect size

When you plan to conduct an experiment, there are some factors that are under direct control of the researcher:

* **Significance level ($\alpha$)**: The probability of finding an effect that does not genuinely exist.
* **Sample size (n)**: The number of observations in each group of the experimental design.

Unlike &alpha; and n, which are specified by the researcher, the magnitude of &beta; depends on the actual value of the population parameter. In addition, &beta; is influenced by the effect size (e.g., Cohen’s d), which can be used to determine a standardized measure of the magnitude of an observed effect. The following parameters are affected more indirectly:

* **Power (1-&beta;)**: The probability of finding an effect that does genuinely exists. 
* **Effect size (d)**: Standardized measure of the effect size under the alternate hypothesis. 

Although &beta; is unknown, it is related to &alpha;. For example, if we would like to be absolutely sure that we do not falsely identify an effect which does not exist (i.e., make a type I error), this means that the probability of identifying an effect that does exist (i.e., 1-&beta;) decreases and vice versa. Thus, an extremely low value of &alpha; (e.g., &alpha; = 0.0001) will result in intolerably high &beta; errors. A common approach is to set &alpha;=0.05 and &beta;=0.80. 

Unlike the t-value of our test, the effect size (d) is unaffected by the sample size and can be categorized as follows (see Cohen, J. 1988): 

* 0.2 (small effect)
* 0.5 (medium effect)
* 0.8 (large effect)

In order to test more subtle effects (smaller effect sizes), you need a larger sample size compared to the test of more obvious effects. In <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2205186" target="_blank">this paper</a>, you can find a list of examples for different effect sizes and the number of observations you need to reliably find an effect of that magnitude. Although the exact effect size is unknown before the experiment, you might be able to make a guess about the effect size (e.g., based on previous studies).   

If you wish to obtain a standardized measure of the effect, you may compute the effect size (Cohen's d) using the ```cohensD()``` function from the ```lsr``` package. Using the examples from the independent-means t-test above, we would use: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lsr)
cohensD(hours ~ group, data = hours_a_b)
```

According to the thresholds defined above, this effect would be judged to be a small-medium effect.

For the dependent-means t-test, we would use: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cohensD(hours_a_b_paired$hours_a, hours_a_b_paired$hours_b, method="paired")
```

According to the thresholds defined above, this effect would also be judged to be a small-medium effect.

When constructing an experimental design, your goal should be to maximize the power of the test while maintaining an acceptable significance level and keeping the sample as small as possible. To achieve this goal, you may use the ```pwr``` package, which let's you compute ```n```, ```d```, ```alpha```, and ```power```. You only need to specify three of the four input variables to get the fourth.

For example, what sample size do we need (per group) to identify an effect with d = 0.6, &alpha; = 0.05, and power = 0.8:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(d = 0.6, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, type = c("two.sample"), alternative = c("two.sided"))
```

Or we could ask, what is the power of our test with 51 observations in each group, d = 0.6, and &alpha; = 0.05:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pwr.t.test(n = 51, d = 0.6, sig.level = 0.05, type = c("two.sample"), alternative = c("two.sided"))
```

#### P-values, stopping rules and p-hacking

From my experience, students tend to place a lot of weight on p-values when interpreting their research findings. It is therefore important to note some points that hopefully help to put the meaning of a "significant" vs. "insignificant" test result into perspective.

**Significant result**

* Even if the probability of the effect being a chance result is small (e.g., less than .05) it doesn't necessarily mean that the effect is important. 
* Very small and unimportant effects can turn out to be statistically significant if the sample size is large enough. 

**Insignificant result**

* If the probability of the effect occurring by chance is large (greater than .05), the alternative hypothesis is rejected. However, this does not mean that the null hypothesis is true.
* Although an effect might not be large enough to be anything other than a chance finding, it doesn't mean that the effect is zero.
* In fact, two random samples will always have slightly different means that would deemed to be statistically significant if the samples were large enough.   

Thus, you should not base your research conclusion on p-values alone!

It is also crucial to **determine the sample size before you run the experiment** or before you start your analysis. Why? Consider the following example:

* You run an experiment
* After each respondent you analyze the data and look at the mean difference between the two groups with a t-test
* You stop when you have a significant effect

This is called p-hacking and should be avoided at all costs. Assuming that both groups come from the same population (i.e., there is **no difference** in the means): What is the likelihood that the result will be significant at some point? In other words, what is the likelihood that you will draw the wrong conclusion from your data that there is an effect, while there is none? This is shown in the following graph using simulated data - the color red indicates significant test results that arise although there is no effect (i.e., false positives).  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "p-hacking (red indicates false positives)"}
set.seed(300)
R <- 1000 
tvalues <- numeric()

replication <- numeric()
group1 <- rnorm(3,1,10)
group2 <- rnorm(3,1,10)

for (r in 1:R) {
  newobs <- rnorm(1,1,10)
  if (runif(1 )> .5) {
    group1 <- c(group1, newobs)
  } else {
    group2 <- c(group2, newobs)
  }
  t <- t.test(group1, group2, var.equal = TRUE)
  tvalues[r] <- t$statistic
  replication[r] <- r
  degf <- (length(group1) + length(group2)-2)
  tcrit[r] <- qt(0.975,degf)
}
df <- as.data.frame(cbind(replication, tvalues,tcrit))
df$col <- ifelse(abs(df$tvalues)>abs(df$tcrit),1,0)

ggplot(data=df,aes(y=tvalues, x=replication,color = col)) +
  geom_line()+theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("black","red"))
```

## Introduction
In the previous section we learned how to compare means using a t-test. The t-test has some limitations since it only lets you compare 2 means and you can only use it with one independent variable. However, often we would like to compare means from 3 or more groups. In addition, there may be instances in which you manipulate more than one independent variable. For these applications, ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) can be used. Hence, to conduct ANOVA you need: 

* A metric dependent variable (i.e., measured using an interval or ratio scale)
* One or more non-metric (categorical) independent variables (also called factors) 

A treatment is a particular combination of factor levels, or categories. One-way ANOVA is used when there is only one categorical variable (factor). In this case, a treatment is the same as a factor level. N-way ANOVA is used with two or more factors. Note that we are only going to talk about a single independent variable in the context of ANOVA. If you have multiple independent variables please refere to the chapter on **Regression**.

Let's use an example to see how ANOVA works. Similar to the previous example it is also imaginable that the music streaming service experiments with a recommendation system for user created playlists. We now have three groups, the control group "A" with the current system, treatment group "B" who have access to playlists created by other users but are not shown recommendations and treatment group "C" who are shown recommendations for user created playlists.  
As always, we load and inspect the data first:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
set.seed(321)
hours_population_1 <- rnorm(25000, 15, 5)
set.seed(125671)
sample_1 <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
sample_1_hours <- hours_population_1[sample_1]
sample_1_df <- data.frame(hours = round(sample_1_hours,0), group = "A")
sample_1_df$index <- 1:100
set.seed(321)
hours_population_2 <- rnorm(25000, 25, 6)
set.seed(125672)
sample_2 <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
sample_2_hours <- hours_population_2[sample_2]
sample_2_df <- data.frame(hours = round(sample_2_hours,0), group = "B")
sample_2_df$index <- 1:100
set.seed(321)
hours_population_3 <- rnorm(25000, 35, 6)
set.seed(125678)
sample_3 <- sample(1:25000, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
sample_3_hours <- hours_population_3[sample_3]
sample_3_df <- data.frame(hours = round(sample_3_hours,0), group = "C")
sample_3_df$index <- 1:100
hours_abc <- rbind(sample_1_df, sample_2_df, sample_3_df)
head(hours_abc)

tail(hours_abc)
```

The null hypothesis, typically, is that all means are equal (non-directional hypothesis). Hence, in our case:

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$$

The alternative hypothesis is simply that the means are not all equal, i.e., 

$$H_1: \textrm{Means are not all equal}$$  

If you wanted to put this in mathematical notation, you could also write:

$$H_1: \exists {i,j}: {\mu_i \ne \mu_j} $$  

To get a first impression if there are any differences in listening times across the experimental groups, we use the ```describeBy(...)``` function from the ```psych``` package:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, paged.print = FALSE}
library(psych)
describeBy(hours_abc$hours, hours_abc$group) #inspect data
```

In addition, you should visualize the data using appropriate plots:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo=TRUE, fig.cap=c("Plot of means"), tidy = FALSE}
#Plot of means
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(hours_abc, aes(group, hours)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "bar", fill = "White", colour = "Black") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = "pointrange") + 
  labs(x = "Experimental group ", y = "Listening time") + 
  theme_bw()
```

Note that ANOVA is an omnibus test, which means that we test for an overall difference between groups. Hence, the test will only tell you if the group means are different, but it won't tell you exactly which groups are different from another.

So why don’t we then just conduct a series of t-tests for all combinations of groups (i.e., A vs. B, A vs. C, B vs. C)? The reason is that if we assume each test to be independent, then there is a 5% probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (Type I error) for each test. In our case:

* A vs. B (&alpha; = 0.05)
* A vs. C (&alpha; = 0.05)
* B vs. C (&alpha; = 0.05)

This means that the overall probability of making a Type I error is 1-(0.95<sup>3</sup>) = 0.143, since the probability of no Type I error is 0.95 for each of the three tests. Consequently, the Type I error probability would be 14.3%, which is above the conventional standard of 5%. This is also known as the family-wise or experiment-wise error.

## Decomposing variance

The basic concept underlying ANOVA is the decomposition of the variance in the data. There are three variance components which we need to consider:

* We calculate how much variability there is between scores: <b>Total sum of squares (SS<sub>T</sub>)</b>
* We then calculate how much of this variability can be explained by the model we fit to the data (i.e., how much variability is due to the experimental manipulation): <b>Model sum of squares (SS<sub>M</sub>)</b>
* … and how much cannot be explained (i.e., how much variability is due to individual differences in performance): <b>Residual sum of squares (SS<sub>R</sub>)</b>

The following figure shows the different variance components using a generalized data matrix:

![Decomposing variance](https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/sum_of_squares.JPG)

The total variation is determined by the variation between the categories (due to our experimental manipulation) and the within-category variation that is due to extraneous factors (e.g., promotion of artists on a social network):   

$$SS_T= SS_M+SS_R$$

To get a better feeling how this relates to our data set, we can look at the data in a slightly different way. Specifically, we can use the ```dcast(...)``` function from the ```reshape2``` package to convert the data to wide format: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo=TRUE, fig.cap=c("Observations"), tidy = FALSE}
library(reshape2)
dcast(hours_abc, index ~ group, value.var = "hours")
```

In this example, X<sub>1</sub> from the generalized data matrix above would refer to the factor level "A", X<sub>2</sub> to the level "B", and X<sub>3</sub> to the level "C". Y<sub>11</sub> refers to the first data point in the first row (i.e., "13"), Y<sub>12</sub> to the second data point in the first row (i.e., "21"), etc.. The grand mean ($\overline{Y}$) and the category means ($\overline{Y}_c$) can be easily computed: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mean(hours_abc$hours) #grand mean
by(hours_abc$hours, hours_abc$group, mean) #category mean
```

To see how each variance component can be derived, let's look at the data again. The following graph shows the individual observations by experimental group:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Sum of Squares"}
#sales <- c(10,9,10,8,9,8,9,7,7,6,8,8,7,9,6,4,5,5,6,4,5,7,6,4,5,2,3,2,1,2)
#promotion <-c(rep(1,10), rep(2,10), rep(3,10))
#count <- c(rep(1:10,3))
d <- hours_abc
d$promotion <- factor(d$group, levels = c(1:3), labels = c("A", "B", "C"))
means <- aggregate(d[,1], list(d$group), mean)
means <- plyr::rename(means, c(Group.1="group"))
d$groupmean <- c(rep(means[1,2],100),rep(means[2,2],100),rep(means[3,2],100))
d$grandmean <- c(mean(d$hours))
#d$group6 <- store <-c(rep(1,5),rep(2,5),rep(3,5),rep(4,5),rep(5,5),rep(6,5))
#d$group6 <- factor(d$group6, levels = c(1:6), labels = c("High/Yes", "High/No", "Medium/Yes", "Medium/No","Low/Yes", "Low/No"))
#means6 <- aggregate(d[,1], list(d$group6), mean)
#means6 <- plyr::rename(means6, c(Group.1="group6"))
#d$groupmean6 <- c(rep(means6[1,2],5),rep(means6[2,2],5),rep(means6[3,2],5),rep(means6[4,2],5),rep(means6[5,2],5),rep(means6[6,2],5))

ggplot(d, aes(x=index,y=hours,color=group)) + 
  geom_point(size=3) + facet_grid(~group, scales = "free_x") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, seq(10, 100, 10),100)) +
  labs(x = "Observations",y = "Listening time", colour="group",size=11, fill="") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text  = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.position="none")+ theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
   # coord_flip()
```

### Total sum of squares

To compute the total variation in the data, we consider the difference between each observation and the grand mean. The grand mean is the mean over all observations in the data set. The vertical lines in the following plot measure how far each observation is away from the grand mean:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Total Sum of Squares"}
ggplot(d, aes(x=index,y=hours,color=group)) + 
  geom_point(size=1) + facet_grid(~group, scales = "free_x") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, seq(10, 100, 10),100)) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = grandmean,color=group)) +
  labs(x = "Observations",y = "Listening Time", colour="Group",size=11, fill="") +
  geom_segment(aes(x=index,y=grandmean, xend=index, yend=hours),size=.5) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text  = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.position="none")+ theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

The formal representation of the total sum of squares (SS<sub>T</sub>) is:

$$
SS_T= \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i-\bar{Y})^2
$$

This means that we need to subtract the grand mean from each individual data point, square the difference, and sum up over all the squared differences. Thus, in our example, the total sum of squares can be calculated as:

$$ 
\begin{align}
SS_T =&(13−24.67)^2 + (14−24.67)^2 + … + (2−24.67)^2\\
      &+(21−24.67)^2 + (18-24.67)^2 + … + (17−24.67)^2\\
      &+(30−24.67)^2 + (37−24.67)^2 + … + (28−24.67)^2\\ 
      &=26646.33
\end{align}
$$

You could also compute this in R using:

```{r}
SST <- sum((hours_abc$hours - mean(hours_abc$hours))^2)
SST
``` 

For the subsequent analyses, it is important to understand the concept behind the <b>degrees of freedom</b>. Remember that in order to estimate a population value from a sample, we need to hold something in the population constant. In ANOVA, the df are generally one less than the number of values used to calculate the SS. For example, when we estimate the population mean from a sample, we assume that the sample mean is equal to the population mean. Then, in order to estimate the population mean from the sample, all but one scores are free to vary and the remaining score needs to be the value that keeps the population mean constant. In our example, we used all 300 observations to calculate the sum of square, so the total degrees of freedom (df<sub>T</sub>) are:

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
df_T = N-1=300-1=299
\end{split}
(\#eq:dfT)
\end{equation} 

### Model sum of squares

Now we know that there are 26646.33 units of total variation in our data. Next, we compute how much of the total variation can be explained by the differences between groups (i.e., our experimental manipulation). To compute the explained variation in the data, we consider the difference between the values predicted by our model for each observation (i.e., the group mean) and the grand mean. The group mean refers to the mean value within the experimental group. The vertical lines in the following plot measure how far the predicted value for each observation (i.e., the group mean) is away from the grand mean:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Model Sum of Squares"}
ggplot(d, aes(x=index,y=hours,color=group)) + 
  geom_point(size=1) + facet_grid(~group, scales = "free_x") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, seq(10, 100, 10), 100)) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = grandmean,color=group)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = groupmean,color=group)) +
  labs(x = "Observations",y = "Listening Time", colour="group",size=11, fill="") +
  geom_segment(aes(x=index,y=grandmean, xend=index, yend=groupmean),size=.3, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, "npc"))) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text  = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.position="none")+ theme_bw()
```

The formal representation of the model sum of squares (SS<sub>M</sub>) is:

$$
SS_M= \sum_{j=1}^{c} n_j(\bar{Y}_j-\bar{Y})^2
$$

where c denotes the number of categories (experimental groups). This means that we need to subtract the grand mean from each group mean, square the difference, and sum up over all the squared differences. Thus, in our example, the model sum of squares can be calculated as:

$$ 
\begin{align}
SS_M &= 100*(15.47−24.67)^2 + 100*(24.88−24.67)^2 + 100*(33.66−24.67)^2 \\
     &= 16550.42
\end{align}
$$

You could also compute this manually in R using:

```{r}
SSM <- sum(100*(by(hours_abc$hours, hours_abc$group, mean) - mean(hours_abc$hours))^2)
SSM
``` 

In this case, we used the three group means to calculate the sum of squares, so the model degrees of freedom (df<sub>M</sub>) are:

$$
df_M= c-1=3-1=2
$$

### Residual sum of squares

Lastly, we calculate the amount of variation that cannot be explained by our model. In ANOVA, this is the sum of squared distances between what the model predicts for each data point (i.e., the group means) and the observed values. In other words, this refers to the amount of variation that is caused by extraneous factors, such as differences between product characteristics of the products in the different experimental groups. The vertical lines in the following plot measure how far each observation is away from the group mean:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Residual Sum of Squares"}
ggplot(d, aes(x=index,y=hours,color=group)) + 
  geom_point(size=1) + facet_grid(~group, scales = "free_x") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,seq(10,100,10))) + geom_hline(data = means, aes(yintercept = x,color=group)) +
  labs(x = "Observations",y = "Listening Time", colour="group",size=11, fill="") +
  geom_segment(aes(x=index,y=groupmean, xend=index, yend=hours),size=.5) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text  = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.position="none")+ theme_bw()
```

The formal representation of the residual sum of squares (SS<sub>R</sub>) is:

$$
SS_R= \sum_{j=1}^{c} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ({Y}_{ij}-\bar{Y}_{j})^2
$$

This means that we need to subtract the group mean from each individual observation, square the difference, and sum up over all the squared differences. Thus, in our example, the model sum of squares can be calculated as:

$$ 
\begin{align}
SS_R =& (13−15.47)^2 + (14−15.47)^2 + … + (2−15.47)^2 \\
     +&(21−24.88)^2 + (18−24.88)^2 + … + (17−24.88)^2 \\
     +& (30−33.66)^2 + (37−33.66)^2 + … + (28−33.66)^2 \\
     =&  10095.91
\end{align}
$$

You could also compute this in R using:

```{r}
SSR <- sum((hours_abc$hours - rep(by(hours_abc$hours, hours_abc$group, mean), each = 100))^2)
SSR
``` 

In this case, we used the 10 values for each of the SS for each group, so the residual degrees of freedom (df<sub>R</sub>) are:

$$
\begin{align}
df_R=& (n_1-1)+(n_2-1)+(n_3-1) \\
    =&(100-1)+(100-1)+(100-1)=297
\end{align}
$$

### Effect strength

Once you have computed the different sum of squares, you can investigate the effect strength. $\eta^2$ is a measure of the variation in Y that is explained by X:

$$
\eta^2= \frac{SS_M}{SS_T}=\frac{16550.42}{26646.33}=0.621
$$

To compute this in R:

```{r}
eta <- SSM/SST
eta
```

The statistic can only take values between 0 and 1. It is equal to 0 when all the category means are equal, indicating that X has no effect on Y. In contrast, it has a value of 1 when there is no variability within each category of X but there is some variability between categories.

### Test of significance

How can we determine whether the effect of X on Y is significant?

* First, we calculate the fit of the most basic model (i.e., the grand mean)
* Then, we calculate the fit of the “best” model (i.e., the group means)
* A good model should fit the data significantly better than the basic model
* The F-statistic or F-ratio compares the amount of systematic variance in the data to the amount of unsystematic variance

The F-statistic uses the ratio of mean square related to X (explained variation) and the mean square related to the error (unexplained variation):

<p style="text-align:center;">
$\frac{SS_M}{SS_R}$ <br>
</p>

However, since these are summed values, their magnitude is influenced by the number of scores that were summed. For example, to calculate SS<sub>M</sub> we only used the sum of 3 values (the group means), while we used 30 and 27 values to calculate SS<sub>T</sub> and SS<sub>R</sub>, respectively. Thus, we calculate the average sum of squares (“mean square”) to compare the average amount of systematic vs. unsystematic variation by dividing the SS values by the degrees of freedom associated with the respective statistic.

Mean square due to X:

$$
MS_M= \frac{SS_M}{df_M}=\frac{SS_M}{c-1}=\frac{16550.42}{(3-1)}
$$

Mean square due to error:

$$
MS_R= \frac{SS_R}{df_R}=\frac{SS_R}{N-c}=\frac{10095.91}{(300-3)}
$$

Now, we compare the amount of variability explained by the model (experiment), to the error in the model (variation due to extraneous variables). If the model explains more variability than it can’t explain, then the experimental manipulation has had a significant effect on the outcome (DV). The F-radio can be derived as follows:

$$
F= \frac{MS_M}{MS_R}=\frac{SS_R}{N-c}=\frac{\frac{16550.42}{(3-1)}}{\frac{10095.91}{(300-3)}}=243.44
$$

You can easily compute this in R:

```{r}
f_ratio <- (SSM/2)/(SSR/297)
f_ratio
```

This statistic follows the F distribution with (m = c – 1) and (n = N – c) degrees of freedom. This means that, like the $\chi^2$ distribution, the shape of the F-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. In this case, the shape depends on the degrees of freedom associated with the numerator and denominator used to compute the F-ratio. The following figure shows the shape of the F-distribution for different degrees of freedom:  

```{r echo = F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=T, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "The F distribution"}
library(ggplot2)
# a <- seq(0,4, 2)
# ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0,4)), aes(x))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(2,2), aes(colour = paste0("m = 2",", n = 2"))) +
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(2,5), aes(colour = paste0("m = 2",", n = 5")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(2,10), aes(colour = paste0("m = 2",", n = 10")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(5,2), aes(colour = paste0("m = 5",", n = 2")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(5,5), aes(colour = paste0("m = 5",", n = 5")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(5,10), aes(colour = paste0("m = 5",", n = 10")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(10,2), aes(colour = paste0("m = 10",", n = 2")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(10,5), aes(colour = paste0("m = 10",", n = 5")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(10,10), aes(colour = paste0("m = 10",", n = 10")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(20,20), aes(colour = paste0("m = 20",", n = 20")))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(2, 297), aes(color = "Our Model:\n m = 2, n = 297")) +
#   ylim(min=0, max=1) +
#   labs(colour = 'Degrees of Freedom', x = 'Value', y = 'Density') + theme_bw()
# ggsave("fdistributions.png")
```

![The F distribution]("./fdistributions.png")

The outcome of the test is one of the following:

* If the null hypothesis of equal category means is not rejected, then the independent variable does not have a significant effect on the dependent variable
* If the null hypothesis is rejected, then the effect of the independent variable is significant  

For 2 and 297 degrees of freedom, the critical value of F is `r  round(qf(.95, df1 = 2, df2 = 297), 3)` for &alpha;=0.05. As usual, you can either look up these values in a table or use the appropriate function in R:

```{r}
f_crit <- qf(.95, df1 = 2, df2 = 297) #critical value
f_crit 
f_ratio > f_crit #test if calculated test statistic is larger than critical value
```

The output tells us that the calculated test statistic exceeds the critical value. We can also show the test result visually:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Visual depiction of the test result"}
df1 <- 2
df2 <- 297
p <- 0.95
min <- 0
max <- 20
f_crit <- round(qf(p,df1=df1,df2=df2), digits = 3)
f_cal <- f_ratio
# plot1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(min, max)), aes(x = x)) +
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(df1,df2))+
#   stat_function(fun = df, args = list(df1,df2), xlim = c(qf(p,df1=df1,df2=df2),max), geom = "area") +
#   scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(round(f_crit, 2), round(f_cal, 2))) +
#   geom_vline(xintercept = f_cal, color = "red") +
#   labs(title = paste0("Result of F-test: reject H0"),
#          subtitle = paste0("Red line: Calculated test statistic;"," Black area: Rejection region"),
#          x = "x", y = "Density") +
#   theme(legend.position="none") + 
#   theme_bw()
# ggsave("ftest.png")
# plot1
```

![Visual depiction of the test result]("./ftest.png")

Thus, we conclude that because F<sub>CAL</sub> = `r round(f_cal,2)` > F<sub>CR</sub> = 3.03, H<sub>0</sub> is rejected!

Interpretation: one or more of the differences between means are statistically significant.

Reporting: There was a significant effect of promotion on sales levels, F(2,297) = `r round(f_cal,2)`, p < 0.05, $\eta^2$ = `r round(eta,2)`. 

Remember: This doesn’t tell us where the differences between groups lie. To find out which group means exactly differ, we need to use post-hoc procedures (see below).

*You don't have to compute these statistics manually!* Luckily, there is a function for ANOVA in R, which does the above calculations for you as we will see in the next section.

## One-way ANOVA

### Basic ANOVA

As already indicated, one-way ANOVA is used when there is only one categorical variable (factor). Before conducting ANOVA, you need to check if the assumptions of the test are fulfilled. The assumptions of ANOVA are discussed in the following sections.

#### Independence of observations {-}

The observations in the groups should be independent. Because we randomly assigned the listeners to the experimental conditions, this assumption can be assumed to be met. 

#### Distributional assumptions {-}

ANOVA is relatively immune to violations to the normality assumption when sample sizes are large due to the Central Limit Theorem. However, if your sample is small (i.e., n < 30 per group) you may nevertheless want to check the normality of your data, e.g., by using the Shapiro-Wilk test or QQ-Plot. In our example, we have 100 observations in each group which is plenty but let's create another example with only 10 observations in each group. In the latter case we cannot rely on the Central Limit Theorem and we should test the normality of our data. This can be done using the Shapiro-Wilk Test, which has the Null Hypothesis that the data is normally distributed. Hence, an insignificant test results means that the data can be assumed to be approximately normally distributed:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, paged.print = FALSE}
set.seed(321)
hours_fewobs <- data.frame(hours = c(rnorm(10, 20, 5), rnorm(10, 40, 5), rnorm(10, 60, 5)),
                          group =  c(rep('A', 10), rep('B', 10), rep('C', 10)))
by(hours_fewobs$hours, hours_fewobs$group, shapiro.test)
```

Since the test result is insignificant for all groups, we can conclude that the data approximately follow a normal distribution. 

We could also test the distributional assumptions visually using a Q-Q plot (i.e., quantile-quantile plot). This plot can be used to assess if a set of data plausibly came from some theoretical distribution such as the Normal distribution. Since this is just a visual check, it is somewhat subjective. But it may help us to judge if our assumption is plausible, and if not, which data points contribute to the violation. A Q-Q plot is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. If both sets of quantiles came from the same distribution, we should see the points forming a line that’s roughly straight. In other words, Q-Q plots take your sample data, sort it in ascending order, and then plot them versus quantiles calculated from a theoretical distribution. Quantiles are often referred to as “percentiles” and refer to the points in your data below which a certain proportion of your data fall. Recall, for example, the standard Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Since the 50th percentile (or 0.5 quantile) is 0, half the data lie below 0. The 95th percentile (or 0.95 quantile), is about 1.64, which means that 95 percent of the data lie below 1.64. The 97.5th quantile is about 1.96, which means that 97.5% of the data lie below 1.96. In the Q-Q plot, the number of quantiles is selected to match the size of your sample data.

To create the Q-Q plot for the normal distribution, you may use the ```qqnorm()``` function, which takes the data to be tested as an argument. Using the ```qqline()``` function subsequently on the data creates the line on which the data points should fall based on the theoretical quantiles. If the individual data points deviate a lot from this line, it means that the data is not likely to follow a normal distribution. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, paged.print = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = c("Q-Q plot 1","Q-Q plot 2","Q-Q plot 3")}
qqnorm(hours_fewobs[hours_fewobs$group=="A",]$hours) 
qqline(hours_fewobs[hours_fewobs$group=="A",]$hours)
qqnorm(hours_fewobs[hours_fewobs$group=="B",]$hours) 
qqline(hours_fewobs[hours_fewobs$group=="B",]$hours)
qqnorm(hours_fewobs[hours_fewobs$group=="C",]$hours) 
qqline(hours_fewobs[hours_fewobs$group=="C",]$hours)
```

The Q-Q plots suggest an approximately Normal distribution. If the assumption had been violated, you might consider transforming your data or resort to a non-parametric test. 

#### Homogeneity of variance {-}

Let's return to our original dataset with 100 observations in each group for the rest of the analysis.

You can test the homogeneity of variances in R using Levene's test:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, paged.print = FALSE}
library(car)
leveneTest(hours ~ group, data = hours_abc, center = mean)
```

The null hypothesis of the test is that the group variances are equal. Thus, if the test result is significant it means that the variances are not equal. If we cannot reject the null hypothesis (i.e., the group variances are not significantly different), we can proceed with the ANOVA as follows: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
aov <- aov(hours ~ group, data = hours_abc)
summary(aov)
```

You can see that the p-value is smaller than 0.05. This means that, if there really was no difference between the population means (i.e., the Null hypothesis was true), the probability of the observed differences (or larger differences) is less than 5%.

To compute &eta;<sup>2</sup> from the output, we can extract the relevant sum of squares as follows

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
summary(aov)[[1]]$'Sum Sq'[1]/(summary(aov)[[1]]$'Sum Sq'[1] + summary(aov)[[1]]$'Sum Sq'[2])
```

You can see that the results match the results from our manual computation above ($\eta^2 =$ `r round(eta, 2)`). 

The ```aov()``` function also automatically generates some plots that you can use to judge if the model assumptions are met. We will inspect two of the plots here.

We will use the first plot to inspect if the residual variances are equal across the experimental groups:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(aov,1)
```

Generally, the residual variance (i.e., the range of values on the y-axis) should be the same for different levels of our independent variable. The plot shows, that there are some slight differences. Notably, the range of residuals is higher in group "B" than in group "C". However, the differences are not that large and since the Levene's test could not reject the Null of equal variances, we conclude that the variances are similar enough in this case. 

The second plot can be used to test the assumption that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. We use a Q-Q plot to test this assumption:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(aov,2)
```

The plot suggests that, the residuals are approximately normally distributed. We could also test this by extracting the residuals from the anova output using the ```resid()``` function and using the Shapiro-Wilk test: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
shapiro.test(resid(aov))
```

Confirming the impression from the Q-Q plot, we cannot reject the Null that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. 

Note that if Levene's test would have been significant (i.e., variances are not equal), we would have needed to either resort to non-parametric tests (see below), or compute the Welch's F-ratio instead:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
oneway.test(hours ~ group, hours_abc)
```

You can see that the results are fairly similar, since the variances turned out to be fairly equal across groups.

### Post-hoc tests

Provided that significant differences were detected by the overall ANOVA you can find out which group means are different using post hoc procedures. Post hoc procedures are designed to conduct pairwise comparisons of all different combinations of the treatment groups by correcting the level of significance for each test such that the overall Type I error rate (&alpha;) across all comparisons remains at 0.05.

In other words, we rejected H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>1</sub>= &mu;<sub>2</sub>= &mu;<sub>3</sub>, and now we would like to test:

Test1: 

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$

Test2: 

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_3$$

Test3: 

$$H_0: \mu_2 = \mu_3$$

There are several post hoc procedures available to choose from. In this tutorial, we will cover Bonferroni and Tukey's HSD ("honest significant differences"). Both tests control for family-wise error. Bonferroni tends to have more power when the number of comparisons is small, whereas Tukey’ HSDs is better when testing large numbers of means. 

#### Bonferroni

One of the most popular (and easiest) methods to correct for the family-wise error rate is to conduct the individual t-tests and divide &alpha; by the number of comparisons („k“):

$$
p_{CR}= \frac{\alpha}{k}
$$ 

In our example with three groups:

$$p_{CR}= \frac{0.05}{3}=0.017$$

Thus, the “corrected” critical p-value is now 0.017 instead of 0.05 (i.e., the critical t value is higher). You can implement the Bonferroni procedure in R using:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
bonferroni <- pairwise.t.test(hours_abc$hours, hours_abc$group, data = hours_abc, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
bonferroni

```

In the output, you will get the corrected p-values for the individual tests. In our example, we can reject H<sub>0</sub> of equal means for all three tests, since p < 0.05 for all combinations of groups.

Note the difference between the results from the post-hoc test compared to individual t-tests. For example, when we test the "B" vs. "C" groups, the result from a t-test would be: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
data_subset <- subset(hours_abc, group != "A")
ttest <- t.test(hours ~ group, data = data_subset, var.equal= TRUE)
ttest
```

Usually the p-value is lower in the t-test, reflecting the fact that the family-wise error is not corrected (i.e., the test is less conservative). In this case the p-value is extremely small in both cases and thus indistinguishable. 

#### Tukey's HSD

Tukey's HSD also compares all possible pairs of means (two-by-two combinations; i.e., like a t-test, except that it corrects for family-wise error rate).

Test statistic:

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
HSD= q\sqrt{\frac{MS_R}{n_c}}
\end{split}
(\#eq:tukey)
\end{equation} 

where:

* q = value from studentized range table (see e.g., <a href="http://www.real-statistics.com/statistics-tables/studentized-range-q-table/" target="_blank">here</a>)
* MS<sub>R</sub> = Mean Square Error from ANOVA
* n<sub>c</sub> = number of observations per group
* Decision: Reject H<sub>0</sub> if

$$|\bar{Y}_i-\bar{Y}_j | > HSD$$

The value from the studentized range table can be obtained using the ```qtukey()``` function.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
q <- qtukey(0.95, nm = 3, df = 297)
q
```

Hence:

$$HSD= 3.33\sqrt{\frac{33.99}{100}}=1.94$$

Or, in R:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
hsd <- q * sqrt(summary(aov)[[1]]$'Mean Sq'[2]/100)
hsd
```

Since all mean differences between groups are larger than 1.906, we can reject the null hypothesis for all individual tests, confirming the results from the Bonferroni test. To compute Tukey's HSD, we can use the appropriate function from the ```multcomp``` package.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(multcomp)
tukeys <- glht(aov, linfct = mcp(group = "Tukey"))
summary(tukeys)
confint(tukeys)
```

We may also plot the result for the mean differences incl. their confidence intervals: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Tukey's HSD"}
plot(tukeys)
```

You can see that the CIs do not cross zero, which means that the true difference between group means is unlikely zero.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mean1 <- mean(hours_abc[hours_abc$group=="A","hours"]) #mean group "A"
mean1
mean2 <- mean(hours_abc[hours_abc$group=="B","hours"]) #mean group "B"
mean2
mean3 <- mean(hours_abc[hours_abc$group=="C","hours"]) #mean group "C"

Reporting of post hoc results: 

The post hoc tests based on Bonferroni and Tukey’s HSD revealed that people listened to music significantly more when:

 - they had access to user created playlists vs. those who did not, 
 - they got recommendations vs. those who did not. This is true for both the control group "A" as well as treatment "B".
 
 
 ### Summary
 
* With One-way ANOVA we test differences in means of at least 3 groups. 
**Familywise or experiment wise error rate.** The reason why we don’t just carry out multiple t-tests to compare 3 or more means between all combinations of groups lies in the fact that, across the groups of test, we would increase Type 1 error (alpha) possibility from acceptable 5% to 14.3%.
*	A metric dependent variable must be continuous (interval or ratio).
*	There is only one independent non-metric (categorical) variable or factor. When there are more than one, we use N-way ANOVA (not covered here).
*	Variances in each group need to be fairly similar (homogeneity of variance).
*	Participants/units/observations in each group must be independent (i.e., randomly assigned to the groups).
*	In terms of normality, distributions within groups should be normally distributed. However, this applies when the sample size is small (approximately less than 30 observations).
*	Hypotheses:
	H0: Means of all groups are equal (non-directional hypothesis).
	H1: Means of all groups are not all equal.
	**Note that from the alternative hypothesis can not be found out which means are not equal!**
*	If you are interested in exploring the data results for any between-group differences between means that exist, you use **post hoc test.**
*	Post hoc tests are designed to compare all different combinations of the treatment groups and you can find out which group means are different.They avoid familywise error by correcting the level of significance for each test such that the overall Type I error rate (α) across all comparisons remains at 0.05.
* Example of application in marketing: If a marketing department of a big international company wants to know whether there is a significant difference in customer satisfaction scores between Europe, USA and Asia, they would certainly look to compare the means of these scores across different markets. Their hypotheses might look like this:
	H0: There is no difference between customer satisfaction scores between Europe, USA, and Asia.
	H1: There is a difference between customer satisfaction scores between Europe, USA and Asia.
  They would need to conduct a post-hoc test to find out in which particular market customers are more satisfied (or not) than in the     others.

## Regression

Correlations measure relationships between variables (i.e., how much two variables covary). Using regression analysis we can predict the outcome of a dependent variable (Y) from one or more independent variables (X). E.g., how many products will we sell if we increase the advertising expenditures by 1000 Euros? In regression analysis, we fit a model to our data and use it to predict the values of the dependent variable from one predictor variable (bivariate regression) or several predictor variables (multiple regression). The following table shows a comparison of correlation and regression analysis:

<br>

&nbsp; | Correlation	 | Regression	
-------------|--------------------------  | -------------------------- 
Estimated coefficient  | Coefficient of correlation (bounded between -1 and +1) | Regression coefficient (not bounded a priori)
Interpretation  | Linear association between two variables; Association is bidirectional | (Linear) relation between one or more independent variables and dependent variable; Relation is directional
Role of theory | Theory neither required nor testable  | Theory required and testable

<br>

### Simple linear regression

In simple linear regression, we assess the relationship between one dependent (regressand) and one independent (regressor) variable. The goal is to fit a line through a scatterplot of observations in order to find the line that best describes the data (scatterplot).

Suppose you are a marketing research analyst at a music label and your task is to suggest, on the basis of past data, a marketing plan for the next year that will maximize product sales. The data set that is available to you includes information on the sales of music downloads (thousands of units), advertising expenditures (in Euros), the number of radio plays an artist received per week (airplay), the number of previous releases of an artist (starpower), repertoire origin (country; 0 = local, 1 = international), and genre (1 = rock, 2 = pop, 3 = electronic). Let's load and inspect the data first: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
regression <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/master/MRDA2017/music_sales_regression.dat", 
                          sep = "\t", 
                          header = TRUE) #read in data
regression$country <- factor(regression$country, levels = c(0:1), labels = c("local", "international")) #convert grouping variable to factor
regression$genre <- factor(regression$genre, levels = c(1:3), labels = c("rock", "pop","electronic")) #convert grouping variable to factor
head(regression)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, paged.print = FALSE}
psych::describe(regression) #descriptive statistics using psych
```

As stated above, regression analysis may be used to relate a quantitative response ("dependent variable") to one or more predictor variables ("independent variables"). In a simple linear regression, we have one dependent and one independent variable.  

Here are a few important questions that we might seek to address based on the data:

* Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales? 
* How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?
* Which other variables contribute to sales?
* How accurately can we estimate the effect of each variable on sales?
* How accurately can we predict future sales?
* Is the relationship linear?
* Is there synergy among the advertising activities?

We may use linear regression to answer these questions. Let's start with the first question and investigate the effect of advertising on sales. 

#### Estimating the coefficients

A simple linear regression model only has one predictor and can be written as:

\begin{equation} 
Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon
(\#eq:regequ)
\end{equation} 

In our specific context, let's consider only the influence of advertising on sales for now:

\begin{equation} 
Sales=\beta_0+\beta_1*adspend+\epsilon
(\#eq:regequadv)
\end{equation} 

The word "adspend" represents data on advertising expenditures that we have observed and &beta;<sub>1</sub> (the "slope"") represents the unknown relationship between advertising expenditures and sales. It tells you by how much sales will increase for an additional Euro spent on advertising. &beta;<sub>0</sub> (the "intercept") is the number of sales we would expect if no money is spent on advertising. Together, &beta;<sub>0</sub> and &beta;<sub>1</sub> represent the model coefficients or parameters. The error term (&epsilon;) captures everything that we miss by using our model, including, (1) misspecifications (the true relationship might not be linear), (2) omitted variables (other variables might drive sales), and (3) measurement error (our measurement of the variables might be imperfect).      

Once we have used our training data to produce estimates for the model coefficients, we can predict future sales on the basis of a particular value of advertising expenditures by computing:

\begin{equation} 
\hat{Sales}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}*adspend
(\#eq:predreg)
\end{equation} 

We use the hat symbol, <sup>^</sup>, to denote the estimated value for an unknown parameter or coefficient, or to denote the predicted value of the response (sales). In practice, &beta;<sub>0</sub> and &beta;<sub>1</sub> are unknown and must be estimated from the data to make predictions. In the case of our advertising example, the data set consists of the advertising budget and product sales (n = 200). Our goal is to obtain coefficient estimates such that the linear model fits the available data well. In other words, we fit a line through the scatterplot of observations and try to find the line that best describes the data. The following graph shows the scatterplot for our data, where the black line shows the regression line. The grey vertical lines shows the difference between the predicted values (the regression line) and the observed values. This difference is referred to as the residuals ("e").

regression <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/master/MRDA2017/multiple_regression.dat", 
                          sep = "\t", 
                          header = TRUE) #read in data
lm <- lm(sales ~ adspend, data = regression)
regression$yhat <- predict(lm)

ggplot(regression, aes(x = adspend,y = sales)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "deepskyblue4") + 
  labs(x = "Advertising expenditure (in Euros)", y = "Sales", size = 11) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = adspend, y = sales, xend = adspend, yend = yhat), 
               color = "grey",size = 0.5, linetype = "solid", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text  = element_text(size = 16),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.position="none") + 
  theme_bw()
```

Estimation of the regression function is based on the idea of the method of least squares (OLS = ordinary least squares). The first step is to calculate the residuals by subtracting the observed values from the predicted values.

<p style="text-align:center;">
$e_i = Y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1X_i)$
</p>

This difference is then minimized by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals:

\begin{equation} 
\sum_{i=1}^{N} e_i^2= \sum_{i=1}^{N} [Y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1X_i)]^2\rightarrow min!
(\#eq:rss)
\end{equation} 

e<sub>i</sub>: Residuals (i = 1,2,...,N)<br>
Y<sub>i</sub>: Values of the dependent variable (i = 1,2,...,N) <br>
&beta;<sub>0</sub>: Intercept<br>
&beta;<sub>1</sub>: Regression coefficient / slope parameters<br>
X<sub>ni</sub>: Values of the nth independent variables and the ith observation<br>
N: Number of observations<br>

This is also referred to as the <b>residual sum of squares (RSS)</b>. Now we need to choose the values for &beta;<sub>0</sub> and &beta;<sub>1</sub> that minimize RSS. So how can we derive these values for the regression coefficient? The equation for &beta;<sub>1</sub> is given by:

\begin{equation} 
\hat{\beta_1}=\frac{COV_{XY}}{s_x^2}
(\#eq:slope)
\end{equation} 

The exact mathematical derivation of this formula is beyond the scope of this script, but the intuition is to calculate the first derivative of the squared residuals with respect to &beta;<sub>1</sub> and set it to zero, thereby finding the &beta;<sub>1</sub> that minimizes the term. Using the above formula, you can easily compute &beta;<sub>1</sub> using the following code:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
cov_y_x <- cov(regression$adspend, regression$sales)
cov_y_x
var_x <- var(regression$adspend)
var_x
beta_1 <- cov_y_x/var_x
beta_1
```

The interpretation of &beta;<sub>1</sub> is as follows: 

For every extra Euros spent on advertising, sales can be expected to increase by `r round(beta_1,3)` units. Or, in other words, if we increase our marketing budget by 1,000 Euros, sales can be expected to increase by `r round(beta_1,3)*1000` units.

Using the estimated coefficient for &beta;<sub>1</sub> , it is easy to compute &beta;<sub>0</sub> (the intercept) as follows:

\begin{equation} 
\hat{\beta_0}=\overline{Y}-\hat{\beta_1}\overline{X}
(\#eq:intercept)
\end{equation} 

The R code for this is:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
beta_0 <- mean(regression$sales) - beta_1*mean(regression$adspend)
beta_0
```

The interpretation of &beta;<sub>0</sub> is as follows: 

If we spend no money on advertising, we would expect to sell `r round(beta_0,3)` units.

You may also verify this based on a scatterplot of the data. The following plot shows the scatterplot including the regression line, which is estimated using OLS.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Scatterplot"}
ggplot(regression, mapping = aes(adspend, sales)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1) + 
  labs(x = "Advertising expenditures (EUR)", y = "Number of sales") + 
  theme_bw()
```

You can see that the regression line intersects with the y-axis at `r round(beta_0,2)`, which corresponds to the expected sales level when advertising expenditure (on the x-axis) is zero (i.e., the intercept &beta;<sub>0</sub>). The slope coefficient (&beta;<sub>1</sub>) tells you by how much sales (on the y-axis) would increase if advertising expenditures (on the x-axis) are increased by one unit.   

#### Significance testing

In a next step, we assess if the effect of advertising on sales is statistically significant. This means that we test the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: "There is no relationship between advertising and sales" versus the alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub>: "The is some relationship between advertising and sales". Or, to state this mathematically:

$$H_0:\beta_1=0$$
$$H_1:\beta_1\ne0$$

How can we test if the effect is statistically significant? Recall the generalized equation to derive a test statistic:

\begin{equation} 
test\ statistic = \frac{effect}{error}
(\#eq:teststatgeneral)
\end{equation} 

The effect is given by the &beta;<sub>1</sub> coefficient in this case. To compute the test statistic, we need to come up with a measure of uncertainty around this estimate (the error). This is because we use information from a sample to estimate the least squares line to make inferences regarding the regression line in the entire population. Since we only have access to one sample, the regression line will be slightly different every time we take a different sample from the population. This is sampling variation and it is perfectly normal! It just means that we need to take into account the uncertainty around the estimate, which is achieved by the standard error. Thus, the test statistic for our hypothesis is given by:

\begin{equation} 
t = \frac{\hat{\beta_1}}{SE(\hat{\beta_1})}
(\#eq:teststatreg)
\end{equation} 

After calculating the test statistic, we compare its value to the values that we would expect to find if there was no effect based on the t-distribution. In a regression context, the degrees of freedom are given by ```N - p - 1``` where N is the sample size and p is the number of predictors. In our case, we have 200 observations and one predictor. Thus, the degrees of freedom is 200 - 1 - 1 = 198. In the regression output below, R provides the exact probability of observing a t value of this magnitude (or larger) if the null hypothesis was true. This probability is the p-value. A small p-value indicates that it is unlikely to observe such a substantial association between the predictor and the outcome variable due to chance in the absence of any real association between the predictor and the outcome.

To estimate the regression model in R, you can use the ```lm()``` function. Within the function, you first specify the dependent variable ("sales") and independent variable ("adspend") separated by a ```~``` (tilde). As mentioned previously, this is known as _formula notation_ in R. The ```data = regression``` argument specifies that the variables come from the data frame named "regression". Strictly speaking, you use the ```lm()``` function to create an object called "simple_regression," which holds the regression output. You can then view the results using the ```summary()``` function: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
simple_regression <- lm(sales ~ adspend, data = regression) #estimate linear model
summary(simple_regression) #summary of results
```

Note that the estimated coefficients for &beta;<sub>0</sub> (`r round(summary(simple_regression)$coefficients[1],3)`) and &beta;<sub>1</sub> (`r round(summary(simple_regression)$coefficients[2],3)`) correspond to the results of our manual computation above. The associated t-values and p-values are given in the output. The t-values are larger than the critical t-values for the 95% confidence level, since the associated p-values are smaller than 0.05. In case of the coefficient for &beta;<sub>1</sub> this means that the probability of an association between the advertising and sales of the observed magnitude (or larger) is smaller than 0.05, if the value of &beta;<sub>1</sub> was, in fact, 0.     

The coefficients associated with the respective variables represent <b>point estimates</b>. To get a better feeling for the range of values that the coefficients could take, it is helpful to compute <b>confidence intervals</b>. A 95% confidence interval is defined as a range of values such that with a 95% probability, the range will contain the true unknown value of the parameter. For example, for &beta;<sub>1</sub>, the confidence interval can be computed as.

\begin{equation} 
CI = \hat{\beta_1}\pm(t_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}*SE(\beta_1))
(\#eq:regCI)
\end{equation} 

It is easy to compute confidence intervals in R using the ```confint()``` function. You just have to provide the name of you estimated model as an argument:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
confint(simple_regression)
```

For our model, the 95% confidence interval for &beta;<sub>0</sub> is [`r round(confint(simple_regression)[1,1],2)`,`r round(confint(simple_regression)[1,2],2)`], and the 95% confidence interval for &beta;<sub>1</sub> is [`r round(confint(simple_regression)[2,1],2)`,`r round(confint(simple_regression)[2,2],2)`]. Thus, we can conclude that when we do not spend any money on advertising, sales will be somewhere between `r round(confint(simple_regression)[1,1],0)` and `r round(confint(simple_regression)[1,2],0)` units on average. In addition, for each increase in advertising expenditures by one Euro, there will be an average increase in sales of between `r round(confint(simple_regression)[2,1],2)` and `r round(confint(simple_regression)[2,2],2)`. 

#### Assessing model fit

Once we have rejected the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, the next step is to investigate to what extent the model represents ("fits") the data. How can we assess the model fit?

* First, we calculate the fit of the most basic model (i.e., the mean)
* Then, we calculate the fit of the best model (i.e., the regression model)
* A good model should fit the data significantly better than the basic model
* R<sup>2</sup>: Represents the percentage of the variation in the outcome that can be explained by the model
* The F-ratio measures how much the model has improved the prediction of the outcome compared to the level of inaccuracy in the model

Similar to ANOVA, the calculation of model fit statistics relies on estimating the different sum of squares values. SS<sub>T</sub> is the difference between the observed data and the mean value of Y (aka. total variation). In the absence of any other information, the mean value of Y represents the best guess on where an observation at a given level of advertising will fall:

\begin{equation} 
SS_T= \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i-\overline{Y})^2
(\#eq:regSST)
\end{equation} 

The following graph shows the total sum of squares:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Total sum of squares"}

regression <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/master/MRDA2017/music_sales_regression.dat", 
                          sep = "\t", 
                          header = TRUE) #read in data
lm <- lm(sales ~ adspend, data = regression)

regression$yhat <- predict(lm)

ggplot(regression, aes(x = adspend, y = sales)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "deepskyblue4") + 
  labs(x = "Advertising", y = "Sales", size = 11) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = adspend, y = sales, xend = adspend, 
                   yend = mean(sales)), color = "grey", 
               size = 0.5, linetype = "solid", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_hline(data = regression, aes(yintercept = mean(sales)), color = "black", size = 1) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text  = element_text(size = 16),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.position="none") + 
  theme_bw()
```

Based on our linear model, the best guess about the sales level at a given level of advertising is the predicted value. The model sum of squares (SS<sub>M</sub>) has the mathematical representation:

\begin{equation} 
SS_M= \sum_{j=1}^{c}  n_j(\overline{Y}_j-\overline{Y})^2
(\#eq:regSSM)
\end{equation} 

The model sum of squares represents the improvement in prediction resulting from using the regression model rather than the mean of the data. The following graph shows the model sum of squares for our example:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Ordinary least squares (OLS)"}
ggplot(regression, aes(x = adspend, y = sales)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "deepskyblue4") + 
  labs(x = "Advertising",y = "Sales", size = 11) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = adspend, y = yhat, xend = adspend, yend = mean(sales)), 
               color = "grey", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  geom_hline(data = regression, aes(yintercept = mean(sales)), color = "black", size = 1) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text  = element_text(size = 16),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.position = "none") + 
  theme_bw()
```

The residual sum of squares (SS<sub>R</sub>) is the difference between the observed data and the predicted values along the regression line (i.e., the variation not explained by the model)

\begin{equation} 
SS_R= \sum_{j=1}^{c} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ({Y}_{ij}-\overline{Y}_{j})^2
(\#eq:regSSR)
\end{equation} 

The following graph shows the residual sum of squares for our example:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Ordinary least squares (OLS)"}
ggplot(regression, aes(x = adspend, y = sales)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "deepskyblue4") + 
  labs(x = "Advertising",y = "Sales", size = 11) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = adspend, y = sales, xend = adspend, yend = yhat),
               color = "grey", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text  = element_text(size = 16),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 16),
        legend.position = "none") + 
  theme_bw()
```

##### R-squared {-}

The R<sup>2</sup> statistic represents the proportion of variance that is explained by the model and is computed as:

\begin{equation} 
R^2= \frac{SS_M}{SS_T}
(\#eq:regSSR)
\end{equation} 

It takes values between 0 (very bad fit) and 1 (very good fit). Note that when the goal of your model is to predict future outcomes, a "too good" model fit can pose severe challenges. The reason is that the model might fit your specific sample so well, that it will only predict well within the sample but not generalize to other samples. This is called **overfitting** and it shows that there is a trade-off between model fit and out-of-sample predictive ability of the model, if the goal is to predict beyond the sample.

You can get a first impression of the fit of the model by inspecting the scatter plot as can be seen in the plot below. If the observations are highly dispersed around the regression line (left plot), the fit will be lower compared to a data set where the values are less dispersed (right plot).

names(sales_data)<-c('sales','adspend')
#summary(sales_data)
examplereg <- subset(sales_data,sales>0 & adspend>0)
#summary(examplereg)

lm <- lm(sales ~ adspend, data = examplereg)
examplereg$yhat <- predict(lm)

scatter_plot2 <- ggplot(examplereg,aes(adspend,sales)) +  
  geom_point(size=2,shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
  geom_smooth(method="lm") + # Add linear examplereg line (by default includes 95% confidence region);
  scale_x_continuous(name="advertising expenditures", limits=c(0, 1800)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name="sales", limits=c(0, 400)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = paste0("R-squared: ",round(summary(lm)$r.squared,2))) 

#p <- plot_grid(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2)
p <- plot_grid(scatter_plot1,scatter_plot2, ncol = 2)
print(p)
# now add the title
#title <- ggdraw() + draw_label("", fontface='bold')
#plot_full <- plot_grid(title, p, ncol=1, rel_heights=c(0.1, 1)) # rel_heights values control title margins
#print(plot_full)
```

The R<sup>2</sup> statistic is reported in the regression output (see above). However, you could also extract the relevant sum of squares statistics from the regression object using the ```anova()``` function to compute it manually: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,paged.print = FALSE}
anova(simple_regression) #anova results
```

Now we can compute R<sup>2</sup> in the same way that we have computed Eta<sup>2</sup> in the last section:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,paged.print = FALSE}
r2 <- anova(simple_regression)$'Sum Sq'[1]/(anova(simple_regression)$'Sum Sq'[1] + anova(simple_regression)$'Sum Sq'[2]) #compute R2
```

##### Adjusted R-squared {-}

Due to the way the R<sup>2</sup> statistic is calculated, it will never decrease if a new explanatory variable is introduced into the model. This means that every new independent variable either doesn't change the R<sup>2</sup> or increases it, even if there is no real relationship between the new variable and the dependent variable. Hence, one could be tempted to just add as many variables as possible to increase the R<sup>2</sup> and thus obtain a "better" model. However, this actually only leads to more noise and therefore a worse model. 

To account for this, there exists a test statistic closely related to the R<sup>2</sup>, the **adjusted R<sup>2</sup>**. It can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation} 
\overline{R^2} = 1 - (1 - R^2)\frac{n-1}{n - k - 1}
(\#eq:adjustedR2)
\end{equation} 

where ```n``` is the total number of observations and ```k``` is the total number of explanatory variables. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is equal to or less than the regular R<sup>2</sup> and can be negative. It will only increase if the added variable adds more explanatory power than one expect by pure chance. Essentially, it contains a "penalty" for including unnecessary variables and therefore favors more parsimonious models. As such, it is a measure of suitability, good for comparing different models and is very useful in the model selection stage of a project. In R, the standard ```lm()``` function automatically also reports the adjusted R<sup>2</sup>.

##### F-test {-}

Another significance test is the F-test. It tests the null hypothesis:

$$H_0:R^2=0$$

<br>

This is equivalent to the following null hypothesis: 

$$H_0:\beta_1=\beta_2=\beta_3=\beta_k=0$$

<br>

The F-test statistic is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation} 
F=\frac{\frac{SS_M}{k}}{\frac{SS_R}{(n-k-1)}}=\frac{MS_M}{MS_R}
(\#eq:regSSR)
\end{equation} 

which has a F distribution with k number of predictors and n degrees of freedom. In other words, you divide the systematic ("explained") variation due to the predictor variables by the unsystematic ("unexplained") variation. 

The result of the F-test is provided in the regression output. However, you might manually compute the F-test using the ANOVA results from the model:  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,paged.print = FALSE}
anova(simple_regression) #anova results
f_calc <- anova(simple_regression)$'Mean Sq'[1]/anova(simple_regression)$'Mean Sq'[2] #compute F
f_calc
f_crit <- qf(.95, df1 = 1, df2 = 100) #critical value
f_crit
f_calc > f_crit #test if calculated test statistic is larger than critical value
```

#### Using the model

After fitting the model, we can use the estimated coefficients to predict sales for different values of advertising. Suppose you want to predict sales for a new product, and the company plans to spend 800 Euros on advertising. How much will it sell? You can easily compute this either by hand:

$$\hat{sales}=134.134 + 0.09612*800=211$$

<br>

... or by extracting the estimated coefficients from the model summary:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
summary(simple_regression)$coefficients[1,1] + # the intercept
summary(simple_regression)$coefficients[2,1]*800 # the slope * 800
```

The predicted value of the dependent variable is 211 units, i.e., the product will (on average) sell 211 units.

### Multiple linear regression

Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique that simultaneously tests the relationships between two or more independent variables and an interval-scaled dependent variable. The general form of the equation is given by:

\begin{equation} 
Y=(\beta_0+\beta_1*X_1+\beta_2*X_2+\beta_n*X_n)+\epsilon
(\#eq:regequ)
\end{equation} 

Again, we aim to find the linear combination of predictors that correlate maximally with the outcome variable. Note that if you change the composition of predictors, the partial regression coefficient of an independent variable will be different from that of the bivariate regression coefficient. This is because the regressors are usually correlated, and any variation in Y that was shared by X1 and X2 was attributed to X1. The interpretation of the partial regression coefficients is the expected change in Y when X is changed by one unit and all other predictors are held constant. 

Let's extend the previous example. Say, in addition to the influence of advertising, you are interested in estimating the influence of airplay on the number of album downloads. The corresponding equation would then be given by:

\begin{equation} 
Sales=\beta_0+\beta_1*adspend+\beta_2*airplay+\epsilon
(\#eq:regequadv)
\end{equation} 

The words "adspend" and "airplay" represent data that we have observed on advertising expenditures and number of radio plays, and &beta;<sub>1</sub> and &beta;<sub>2</sub> represent the unknown relationship between sales and advertising expenditures and radio airplay, respectively. The coefficients tells you by how much sales will increase for an additional Euro spent on advertising (when radio airplay is held constant) and by how much sales will increase for an additional radio play (when advertising expenditures are held constant). Thus, we can make predictions about album sales based not only on advertising spending, but also on radio airplay.

With several predictors, the partitioning of sum of squares is the same as in the bivariate model, except that the model is no longer a 2-D straight line. With two predictors, the regression line becomes a 3-D regression plane. In our example:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Regression plane"}
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44322350/add-regression-plane-in-r-using-plotly
library(plotly)
library(reshape2)
n <- nrow(regression)
x1 <- regression$adspend
x2 <- regression$airplay
x3 <- regression$starpower
y <- regression$sales
df <- data.frame(y, x1, x2, x3)

### Estimation of the regression plane
mod <- lm(y ~ x1+x2)
cf.mod <- coef(mod)

### Calculate z on a grid of x-y values
x1.seq <- seq(min(x1),max(x1),length.out=25)
x2.seq <- seq(min(x2),max(x2),length.out=25)
z <- t(outer(x1.seq, x2.seq, function(x,y) cf.mod[1]+cf.mod[2]*x+cf.mod[3]*y))

#### Draw the plane with "plot_ly" and add points with "add_trace"
cols <- c("#f5cb11", "#b31d83")
cols <- cols[x3+1] 
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(x=~x1.seq, y=~x2.seq, z=~z,
  colors = c("#A9D0F5", "#08088A"),type="surface") %>%
  add_trace(data=df, x=x1, y=x2, z=y, mode="markers", type="scatter3d",
  marker = list(color=cols, size=3, opacity=0.8, symbol=75)) %>%
  layout(scene = list(
    aspectmode = "manual", aspectratio = list(x=1, y=1, z=1),
    xaxis = list(title = "adspend", range = c(0,2300)),
    yaxis = list(title = "airplay", range = c(0,70)),
    zaxis = list(title = "sales", range = pretty(z)[c(1,8)])))
p
```

Like in the bivariate case, the plane is fitted to the data with the aim to predict the observed data as good as possible. The deviation of the observations from the plane represent the residuals (the error we make in predicting the observed data from the model). Note that this is conceptually the same as in the bivariate case, except that the computation is more complex (we won't go into details here). The model is fairly easy to plot using a 3-D scatterplot, because we only have two predictors. While multiple regression models that have more than two predictors are not as easy to visualize, you may apply the same principles when interpreting the model outcome:

* Total sum of squares (SS<sub>T</sub>) is still the difference between the observed data and the mean value of Y (total variation)
* Residual sum of squares (SS<sub>R</sub>) is still the difference between the observed data and the values predicted by the model (unexplained variation)
* Model sum of squares (SS<sub>M</sub>) is still the difference between the values predicted by the model and the mean value of Y (explained variation)
* R measures the multiple correlation between the predictors and the outcome
* R<sup>2</sup> is the amount of variation in the outcome variable explained by the model

Estimating multiple regression models is straightforward using the ```lm()``` function. You just need to separate the individual predictors on the right hand side of the equation using the ```+``` symbol. For example, the model:

\begin{equation} 
Sales=\beta_0+\beta_1*adspend+\beta_2*airplay+\beta_3*starpower+\epsilon
(\#eq:regequadv)
\end{equation} 

could be estimated as follows: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
multiple_regression <- lm(sales ~ adspend + airplay + starpower, data = regression) #estimate linear model
summary(multiple_regression) #summary of results
```

The interpretation of the coefficients is as follows: 

* adspend (&beta;<sub>1</sub>): when advertising expenditures increase by 1 Euro, sales will increase by `r round(summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[2],3)` units
* airplay (&beta;<sub>2</sub>): when radio airplay increases by 1 play per week, sales will increase by `r round(summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[3],3)` units
* starpower (&beta;<sub>3</sub>): when the number of previous albums increases by 1, sales will increase by `r round(summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[4],3)` units

The associated t-values and p-values are also given in the output. You can see that the p-values are smaller than 0.05 for all three coefficients. Hence, all effects are "significant". This means that if the null hypothesis was true (i.e., there was no effect between the variables and sales), the probability of observing associations of the estimated magnitudes (or larger) is very small (e.g., smaller than 0.05).     

Again, to get a better feeling for the range of values that the coefficients could take, it is helpful to compute <b>confidence intervals</b>. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
confint(multiple_regression)
```

What does this tell you? Recall that a 95% confidence interval is defined as a range of values such that with a 95% probability, the range will contain the true unknown value of the parameter. For example, for &beta;<sub>3</sub>, the confidence interval is [`r confint(multiple_regression)[4,1]`,`r confint(multiple_regression)[4,2]`]. Thus, although we have computed a point estimate of `r round(summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[4],3)` for the effect of starpower on sales based on our sample, the effect might actually just as well take any other value within this range, considering the sample size and the variability in our data.  

The output also tells us that `r summary(multiple_regression)$r.squared*100`% of the variation can be explained by our model. You may also visually inspect the fit of the model by plotting the predicted values against the observed values. We can extract the predicted values using the ```predict()``` function. So let's create a new variable ```yhat```, which contains those predicted values.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
regression$yhat <- predict(simple_regression)
```

We can now use this variable to plot the predicted values against the observed values. In the following plot, the model fit would be perfect if all points would fall on the diagonal line. The larger the distance between the points and the line, the worse the model fit.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Model fit"}
ggplot(regression,aes(yhat,sales)) +  
  geom_point(size=2,shape=1) +  #Use hollow circles
  scale_x_continuous(name="predicted values") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="observed values") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  theme_bw()
```

**Partial plots**

In the context of a simple linear regression (i.e., with a single independent variable), a scatter plot of the dependent variable against the independent variable provides a good indication of the nature of the relationship. If there is more than one independent variable, however, things become more complicated. The reason is that although the scatter plot still show the relationship between the two variables, it does not take into account the effect of the other independent variables in the model. Partial regression plot show the effect of adding another variable to a model that already controls for the remaining variables in the model. In other words, it is a scatterplot of the residuals of the outcome variable and each predictor when both variables are regressed separately on the remaining predictors. As an example, consider the effect of advertising expenditures on sales. In this case, the partial plot would show the effect of adding advertising expenditures as an explanatory variable while controlling for the variation that is explained by airplay and starpower in both variables (sales and advertising). Think of it as the purified relationship between advertising and sales that remains after controlling for other factors. The partial plots can easily be created using the ```avPlots()``` function from the ```car``` package:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Partial plots"}
library(car)
avPlots(multiple_regression)
```

**Using the model**

After fitting the model, we can use the estimated coefficients to predict sales for different values of advertising, airplay, and starpower. Suppose you would like to predict sales for a new music album with advertising expenditures of 800, airplay of 30 and starpower of 5. How much will it sell?

$$\hat{sales}=−26.61 + 0.084 * 800 + 3.367*30 + 11.08 ∗ 5= 197.74$$

<br>

... or by extracting the estimated coefficients:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[1,1] + 
  summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[2,1]*800 + 
  summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[3,1]*30 + 
  summary(multiple_regression)$coefficients[4,1]*5
```

The predicted value of the dependent variable is 198 units, i.e., the product will sell 198 units.

**Comparing effects**

Using the output from the regression model above, it is difficult to compare the effects of the independent variables because they are all measured on different scales (Euros, radio plays, releases). Standardized regression coefficients can be used to judge the relative importance of the predictor variables. Standardization is achieved by multiplying the unstandardized coefficient by the ratio of the standard deviations of the independent and dependent variables:

\begin{equation} 
B_{k}=\beta_{k} * \frac{s_{x_k}}{s_y}
(\#eq:stdcoeff)
\end{equation}

Hence, the standardized coefficient will tell you by how many standard deviations the outcome will change as a result of a one standard deviation change in the predictor variable. Standardized coefficients can be easily computed using the ```lm.beta()``` function from the ```lm.beta``` package.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(lm.beta)
lm.beta(multiple_regression)
```

The results show that for ```adspend``` and ```airplay```, a change by one standard deviation will result in a 0.51 standard deviation change in sales, whereas for ```starpower```, a one standard deviation change will only lead to a 0.19 standard deviation change in sales. Hence, while the effects of ```adspend``` and ```airplay``` are comparable in magnitude, the effect of ```starpower``` is less strong.

## Potential problems

Once you have built and estimated your model it is important to run diagnostics to ensure that the results are accurate. In the following section we will discuss common problems.

### Outliers

**The following video summarizes how to handle outliers in R**

<div align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9lcBwWVdyU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


Outliers are data points that differ vastly from the trend. They can introduce bias into a model due to the fact that they alter the parameter estimates. Consider the example below. A linear regression was performed twice on the same data set, except during the second estimation the two green points were changed to be outliers by being moved to the positions indicated in red. The solid red line is the regression line based on the unaltered data set, while the dotted line was estimated using the altered data set. As you can see the second regression would lead to  different conclusions than the first. Therefore it is important to identify outliers and further deal with them. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.cap = "Effects of outliers", fig.align="center"}
set.seed(123)
x <- 1:30
y <- x*2.8 + rnorm(30, sd = 10)

y_altered <- y
y_altered[29] <- -50
y_altered[27] <- -47

ggplot(data = data.frame(X = x, Y = y, Y_alt = y_altered), aes(x = X, y = Y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = X, y = Y_alt), col = "red") + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = 27, y = Y[27]), col = "green") +
  geom_point(aes(x = 29, y = Y[29]), col = "green") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "firebrick", lwd = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x = X, y = Y_alt), method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "black", lwd = 0.5, lty = 2) +
  theme_bw()


```

One quick way to visually detect outliers is by creating a scatterplot (as above) to see whether anything seems off. Another approach is to inspect the studentized residuals. If there are no outliers in your data, about 95% will be between -2 and 2, as per the assumptions of the normal distribution. Values well outside of this range are unlikely to happen by chance and warrant further inspection. As a rule of thumb, observations whose studentized residuals are greater than 3 in absolute values are potential outliers.

The studentized residuals can be obtained in R with the function ```rstudent()```. We can use this function to create a new variable that contains the studentized residuals e music sales regression from before yields the following residuals:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
regression$stud_resid <- rstudent(multiple_regression)
head(regression)
```

A good way to visually inspect the studentized residuals is to plot them in a scatterplot and roughly check if most of the observations are within the -3, 3 bounds. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot of the studentized residuals", fig.align="center"}
plot(1:nrow(regression),regression$stud_resid, ylim=c(-3.3,3.3)) #create scatterplot 
abline(h=c(-3,3),col="red",lty=2) #add reference lines
```

To identify potentially influential observations in our data set, we can apply a filter to our data:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
outliers <- subset(regression,abs(stud_resid)>3)
outliers
```

After a detailed inspection of the potential outliers, you might decide to delete the affected observations from the data set or not. If an outlier has resulted from an error in data collection, then you might simply remove the observation. However, even though data may have extreme values, they might not be influential to determine a regression line. That means, the results wouldn’t be much different if we either include or exclude them from analysis. This means that the decision of whether to exclude an outlier or not is closely related to the question whether this observation is an influential observation, as will be discussed next.  

### Influential observations

Related to the issue of outliers is that of influential observations, meaning observations that exert undue influence on the parameters. It is possible to determine whether or not the results are driven by an influential observation by calculating how far the predicted values for your data would move if the model was fitted without this particular observation. This calculated total distance is called **Cook's distance**. To identify influential observations, we can inspect the respective plots created from the model output. A rule of thumb to determine whether an observation should be classified as influential or not is to look for observation with a Cook's distance > 1 (although opinions vary on this). The following plot can be used to see the Cook's distance associated with each data point:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Cook's distance"}
plot(multiple_regression,4)
```

It is easy to see that none of the Cook's distance values is close to the critical value of 1. Another useful plot to identify influential observations is plot number 5 from the output: 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Residuals vs. Leverage"}
plot(multiple_regression,5)
```

In this plot, we look for cases outside of a dashed line, which represents **Cook’s distance**. Lines for Cook’s distance thresholds of 0.5 and 1 are included by default. In our example, this line is not even visible, since the Cook’s distance values are far away from the critical values. Generally, you would watch out for outlying values at the upper right corner or at the lower right corner of the plot. Those spots are the places where cases can be influential against a regression line. In our example, there are no influential cases.

To see how influential observations can impact your regression, have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet" target="_blank">this example</a>.

### Non-linearity

An important underlying assumption for OLS is that of linearity, meaning that the relationship between the dependent and the independent variable can be reasonably approximated in linear terms. One quick way to assess whether a linear relationship can be assumed is to inspect the added variable plots that we already came across earlier:  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Partial plots"}
library(car)
avPlots(multiple_regression)
```

In our example, it appears that linear relationships can be reasonably assumed. Please note, however, that the assumption of linearity implies two things:

* Constant marginal returns (e.g., an increase in ad-spend from 10€ to 11€ yields the same increase in sales as an increase from 100,000€ to 100,001€)
* Elasticities increase with X (e.g., advertising becomes relatively more effective; i.e., a relatively smaller change in advertising expenditure will yield the same return)

These assumptions may not be justifiable in certain contexts and you might have to transform your data (e.g., using log-transformations) in these cases, as we will see below.

### Non-constant error variance

**The following video summarizes how to identify non-constant error variance in R**

<div align="center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bcYdQlQJZ_U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Another important assumption of the linear model is that the error terms have a constant variance (i.e., homoscedasticity). The following plot from the model output shows the residuals (the vertical distance from an observed value to the predicted values) versus the fitted values (the predicted value from the regression model). If all the points fell exactly on the dashed grey line, it would mean that we have a perfect prediction. The residual variance (i.e., the spread of the values on the y-axis) should be similar across the scale of the fitted values on the x-axis. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Residuals vs. fitted values"}
plot(multiple_regression, 1)
```

In our case, this appears to be the case. You can identify non-constant variances in the errors (i.e., heteroscedasticity) from the presence of a funnel shape in the above plot. When the assumption of constant error variances is not met, this might be due to a misspecification of your model (e.g., the relationship might not be linear). In these cases, it often helps to transform your data (e.g., using log-transformations). The red line also helps you to identify potential misspecification of your model. It is a smoothed curve that passes through the residuals and if it lies close to the gray dashed line (as in our case) it suggest a correct specification. If the line would deviate from the dashed grey line a lot (e.g., a U-shape or inverse U-shape), it would suggest that the linear model specification is not reasonable and you should try different specifications.   

If OLS is performed despite heteroscedasticity, the estimates of the coefficient will still be correct on average. However, the estimator is _inefficient_, meaning that the standard error is wrong, which will impact the significance tests (i.e., the p-values will be wrong). However, there are also robust regression methods, which you can use to estimate your model despite the presence of heteroscedasticity. 

### Non-normally distributed errors

Another assumption of OLS is that the error term is normally distributed. This can be a reasonable assumption for many scenarios, but we still need a way to check if it is actually the case. As we can not directly observe the actual error term, we have to work with the next best thing - the residuals. 

A quick way to assess whether a given sample is approximately normally distributed is by using Q-Q plots. These plot the theoretical position of the observations (under the assumption that they are normally distributed) against the actual position. The plot below is created by the model output and shows the residuals in a Q-Q plot. As you can see, most of the points roughly follow the theoretical distribution, as given by the straight line. If most of the points are close to the line, the data is approximately normally distributed.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Q-Q plot"}
plot(multiple_regression,2)
```

Another way to check for normal distribution of the data is to employ statistical tests that test the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed, such as the Shapiro–Wilk test. We can extract the residuals from our model using the ```resid()``` function and apply the ```shapiro.test()``` function to it:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Normally distributed Q-Q plot"}
shapiro.test(resid(multiple_regression))
```

As you can see, we can not reject the H<sub>0</sub> of the normally distributed residuals, which means that we can assume the residuals to be approximately normally distributed.

When the assumption of normally distributed errors is not met, this might again be due to a misspecification of your model, in which case it might help to transform your data (e.g., using log-transformations).

### Correlation of errors

The assumption of independent errors implies that for any two observations the residual terms should be uncorrelated. This is also known as a _lack of autocorrelation_. In theory, this could be tested with the Durbin-Watson test, which checks whether adjacent residuals are correlated. However, be aware that the test is sensitive to the order of your data. Hence, it only makes sense if there is a natural order in the data (e.g., time-series data) when the presence of dependent errors indicates autocorrelation. **Since there is no natural order in our data, we don't need to apply this test.**.

If you are confronted with data that has a natural order, you can performed the test using the command ```durbinWatsonTest()```, which takes the object that the ```lm()``` function generates as an argument. The test statistic varies between 0 and 4, with values close to 2 being desirable. As a rule of thumb values below 1 and above 3 are causes for concern. 

### Collinearity

Linear dependence of regressors, also known as multicollinearity, is when there is a strong linear relationship between the independent variables. Some correlation will always be present, but severe correlation can make proper estimation impossible. When present, it affects the model in several ways:

* Limits the size of R<sup>2</sup>: when two variables are highly correlated, the amount of unique explained variance is low; therefore the incremental change in R<sup>2</sup> by including an additional predictor is larger if the predictor is uncorrelated with the other predictors.
* Increases the standard errors of the coefficients, making them less trustworthy.
* Uncertainty about the importance of predictors: if two predictors explain similar variance in the outcome, we cannot know which of these variables is important.  

A quick way to find obvious multicollinearity is to examine the correlation matrix of the data. Any value > 0.8 - 0.9 should be cause for concern. You can, for example, create a correlation matrix using the ```rcorr()``` function from the ```Hmisc``` package.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("Hmisc")
rcorr(as.matrix(regression[,c("adspend","airplay","starpower")]))
```

The bivariate correlations can also be show in a plot:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Bivariate correlation plots"}
plot(regression[,c("adspend","airplay","starpower")])
```

However, this only spots bivariate multicollinearity. Variance inflation factors can be used to spot more subtle multicollinearity arising from multivariate relationships. It is calculated by regressing X<sub>i</sub> on all other X and using the resulting R<sup>2</sup> to calculate

\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}
\end{split}
(\#eq:VIF)
\end{equation} 

VIF values of over 4 are certainly cause for concern and values over 2 should be further investigated. If the average VIF is over 1 the regression may be biased. The VIF for all variables can easily be calculated in R with the ```vif()``` function. 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(car)
vif(multiple_regression)
```

As you can see the values are well below the cutoff, indicating that we do not have to worry about multicollinearity in our example.  

### Omitted Variables

If a variable that influences the outcome is left out of the model ("omitted"), a bias in other variables' coefficients might be introduced. Specifically, the other coefficients will be biased if the corresponding variables are correlated with the omitted variable. Intuitively, the variables left in the model "pick up" the effect of the omitted variable to the degree that they are related. Let's illustrate this with an example.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
avg_rating <- runif(100, 0, 10)
followers <- round(runif(100, 100, 10000)) + 300*avg_rating

concert_visitors <- 20.3*avg_rating + 0.2*followers + rnorm(100, 0, 20)
concerts <- data.frame(avg_rating, followers, concert_visitors)
```

Consider the following data on the number of people visiting concerts of smaller bands. 

```{r}
head(concerts)
```

The data set contains three variables:

 * **avg_rating**: The average rating a band has, resulting from a ten-point scale.
 * **followers**: The number of followers the band has at the time of the concert.
 * **concert_visitors**: The number of tickets sold for the concert. 

If we estimate a model to explain the number of tickets sold as a function of the average rating and the number of followers, the results would look as follows: 
```{r }
concert_mod <- lm(concert_visitors ~ avg_rating + followers, data = concerts)
summary(concert_mod)
```

Now assume we don't have data on the number of followers a band has, but we still have information on the average rating and want to explain the number of tickets sold. Fitting a linear model with just the ```avg_rating``` variable included yields the following results:

```{r}
concert_mod2 <- lm(concert_visitors ~ avg_rating, data = concerts)
summary(concert_mod2)
```

What happens to the coefficient of ```avg_rating```? Because ```avg_rating``` and ```followers```are not independent (e.g. one could argue that bands with a higher average rating probably have more followers) the coefficient will be biased. In our case we massively overestimate the effect that the average rating of a band has on ticket sales. In the original model, the effect was about `r round(coefficients(concert_mod)[2], 1)`. In the new, smaller model, the effect is approximately `r round(coefficients(concert_mod2)[2]/coefficients(concert_mod)[2], 1)` times higher.

We can also work out intuitively what the bias will be. The marginal effect of ```followers``` on ```concert_visitors``` is captured by ```avg_rating``` to the degree that ```avg_rating``` is related to ```followers```. There are two coefficients of interest: 

  1. What is the marginal effect of ```followers``` on ```concert_visitors```? 
  2. How much of that effect is captured by ```avg_rating```? 

The former is just the coefficient of ```followers``` in the original regression. 
```{r}
followers_concert_mod <- as.numeric(coef(concert_mod)["followers"]) # Marginal effect of followers on sales
followers_concert_mod
```

The latter is the coefficient of ```avg_rating``` obtained from a regression on ```followers```, since the coefficient shows how ```avg_rating``` and ```followers``` relate to each other.

```{r}
mod_follow_rating <- lm(followers ~ avg_rating, data = concerts) 
follow_rating <- as.numeric(coef(mod_follow_rating)["avg_rating"]) # Relation between followers and avg_rating
follow_rating
```

Now we can calculate the bias induced by omitting ```followers```

```{r}
bias <- followers_concert_mod * follow_rating
cat("Bias:", bias)
```

To calculate the biased coefficient, simply add the bias to the coefficient from the original model. 

```{r}
b1_bias <- coef(concert_mod)["avg_rating"] + bias
cat("Biased Beta:", b1_bias)
```


## Categorical predictors

```{r echo=F, eval=T}
regression$country <- factor(regression$country, levels = c(0:1), labels = c("local", "international")) #convert grouping variable to factor
regression$genre <- factor(regression$genre, levels = c(1:3), labels = c("rock", "pop","electronic")) #convert grouping variable to factor
```

### Two categories

Suppose, you wish to investigate the effect of the variable "country" on sales, which is a categorical variable that can only take two levels (i.e., 0 = local artist, 1 = international artist). Categorical variables with two levels are also called binary predictors. It is straightforward to include these variables in your model as "dummy" variables. Dummy variables are factor variables that can only take two values. For our "country" variable, we can create a new predictor variable that takes the form:

\begin{equation} 
x_4 =
  \begin{cases}
    1       & \quad \text{if } i \text{th artist is international}\\
    0  & \quad \text{if } i \text{th artist is local}
  \end{cases}
(\#eq:dummycoding)
\end{equation} 

This new variable is then added to our regression equation from before, so that the equation becomes 

\begin{align}
Sales =\beta_0 &+\beta_1*adspend\\
      &+\beta_2*airplay\\
      &+\beta_3*starpower\\ 
      &+\beta_4*international+\epsilon
\end{align}

where "international" represents the new dummy variable and $\beta_4$ is the coefficient associated with this variable. Estimating the model is straightforward - you just need to include the variable as an additional predictor variable. Note that the variable needs to be specified as a factor variable before including it in your model. If you haven't converted it to a factor variable before, you could also use the wrapper function ```as.factor()``` within the equation. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
multiple_regression_bin <- lm(sales ~ adspend + airplay + starpower + country, data = regression) #estimate linear model
summary(multiple_regression_bin) #summary of results
```

You can see that we now have an additional coefficient in the regression output, which tells us the effect of the binary predictor. The dummy variable can generally be interpreted as the average difference in the dependent variable between the two groups (similar to a t-test). In this case, the coefficient tells you the difference in sales between international and local artists, and whether this difference is significant. Specifically, it means that international artists on average sell 45.67 units more than local artists, and this difference is significant (i.e., p < 0.05).  

### More than two categories

Predictors with more than two categories, like our "genre"" variable, can also be included in your model. However, in this case one dummy variable cannot represent all possible values, since there are three genres (i.e., 1 = Rock, 2 = Pop, 3 = Electronic). Thus, we need to create additional dummy variables. For example, for our "genre" variable, we create two dummy variables as follows:

\begin{equation} 
x_5 =
  \begin{cases}
    1       & \quad \text{if } i \text{th  product is from Pop genre}\\
    0  & \quad \text{if } i \text{th product is from Rock genre}
  \end{cases}
(\#eq:dummycoding1)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation} 
x_6 =
  \begin{cases}
    1       & \quad \text{if } i \text{th  product is from Electronic genre}\\
    0  & \quad \text{if } i \text{th product is from Rock genre}
  \end{cases}
(\#eq:dummycoding2)
\end{equation} 

We would then add these variables as additional predictors in the regression equation and obtain the following model

\begin{align}
Sales =\beta_0 &+\beta_1*adspend\\
      &+\beta_2*airplay\\
      &+\beta_3*starpower\\ 
      &+\beta_4*international\\
      &+\beta_5*Pop\\
      &+\beta_6*Electronic+\epsilon
\end{align}

where "Pop" and "Rock" represent our new dummy variables, and $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$ represent the associated regression coefficients. 

The interpretation of the coefficients is as follows: $\beta_5$ is the difference in average sales between the genres "Rock" and "Pop", while $\beta_6$ is the difference in average sales between the genres "Rock" and "Electro". Note that the level for which no dummy variable is created is also referred to as the *baseline*. In our case, "Rock" would be the baseline genre. This means that there will always be one fewer dummy variable than the number of levels.

You don't have to create the dummy variables manually as R will do this automatically when you add the variable to your equation: 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
multiple_regression <- lm(sales ~ adspend + airplay + starpower+ country + genre, data = regression) #estimate linear model
summary(multiple_regression) #summary of results
```

How can we interpret the coefficients? It is estimated based on our model that products from the "Pop" genre will on average sell 47.69 units more than products from the "Rock" genre, and that products from the "Electronic" genre will sell on average 27.62 units more than the products from the "Rock" genre. The p-value of both variables is smaller than 0.05, suggesting that there is statistical evidence for a real difference in sales between the genres.

The level of the baseline category is arbitrary. As you have seen, R simply selects the first level as the baseline. If you would like to use a different baseline category, you can use the ```relevel()``` function and set the reference category using the ```ref``` argument. The following would estimate the same model using the second category as the baseline:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
multiple_regression <- lm(sales ~ adspend + airplay + starpower+ country + relevel(genre,ref=2), data = regression) #estimate linear model
summary(multiple_regression) #summary of results
```

Note that while your choice of the baseline category impacts the coefficients and the significance level, the prediction for each group will be the same regardless of this choice.

### Summary

*	Regression analysis is a way of predicting an outcome (dependent) variable from one predictor (independent) variable (simple regression) or several predictor variables (multiple regression).
*	In a simple linear regression, we do this by fitting a statistical model to the data in the form of a straight line.
*	The regression line is a line that goes through, or as close as possible to, as many of the data points as possible.
*	R-squared indicates how much variance is explained by the model compared to how much variance there is to explain at all. It can be defined as the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that is shared by the predictor variable.
*	F-statistic denotes the extent to which the model can explain variability relative to the extent to which the model cannot explain it.
*	Beta coefficient in a single linear regression determines the slope of the regression line and the strength of the relationship between a predictor and the outcome. The coefficient is significant if Pr(>|t|) < .05. 
*	Beta coefficient shows the extent to which the outcome variable changes when comes to one-unit change in the predictor variable.
*	Intercept shows the value that dependent variable holds when beta coefficients are 0.
*	Confidence interval of beta coefficient tell us, if we’d collected 100 samples, and calculated the confidence intervals for a beta coefficient, that 95% of these confidence intervals (out of 100) would contain the true value of beta coefficient.
*	Assessing the regression model:
  Check for the outliers and influential cases as they can cause a bias, because they influence the values of the estimated regression   coefficients.
*	Check for the linearity, meaning that the relationship between the dependent and the independent variable can be reasonably             approximated in linear terms.
*	Check that the error terms have a constant variance (homoscedasticity).
*	Check that the error term is normally distributed.
*	Check for the “third-variables” that are left out the model, but influence the outcome, and therefore introduce a bias in other         variables’ coefficients.
* Example of application in marketing: digital marketers usally have to assess how Euros put into online advertising contributes to sales. Most of times companies are running advertising on different channels. If you have run Google ads, Facebook ads and newspaper ads, the question that you as a digital marketer could wonder about is ads performance. Given that you collected enough data, you can apply multiple regression and calucate how much an additional Euro put in each of those channels drives additional sales.
